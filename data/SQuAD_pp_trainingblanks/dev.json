In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European ______ article 34 , \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019 . In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly , actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34 .

France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage .

Although many companies , including Mr Schmidberger 's German undertaking , were prevented from trading , the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019 , against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced , and was probably subordinate .

In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein , the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs ( not just imported ones ) to have a minimum alcohol content of ______ per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports . German liqueurs were over ______ per cent alcohol , but Cassis de Dijon , which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from ______ , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol . The Court of Justice rejected the German government 's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36 , because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought . This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product 's content or packaging . In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34 , and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection . The argument that Belgians would believe it was ______ if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate : it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \" . In a ______ case , Commission v Italy Italian law required that ______ products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \" . It had to be \" chocolate substitute \" . All Italian chocolate was made from ______ ______ alone , but British , Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats . They claimed the law infringed article 34 . The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label . This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes . A \u2018 neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers . If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product , this can also infringe article 34 . So , in a 2009 case , Commission v Italy , the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34 . Again , the law applied neutrally to everyone , but disproportionately affected importers , because Italian companies did not make trailers . This was not a product requirement , but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it : it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \" .

In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio , TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy their products , but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health .

By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel 's claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement . Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \" , because the charge applied equally to Austrians , in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified . Third , people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \" , although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods . In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium , because the benefit was \" closely linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Netherlands . Conversely , in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands , but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany , did not have a right to receive German child benefits , even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was resident in Austria could . The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3 ) are \" public policy , public security or public health \" , and there is also a general exception in article 45(4 ) for \" employment in the public service \" .", "blank_classification": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"context_blanked": "______ of the ______ has increasingly been seen as a \" fundamental \" status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice , and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move .

The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied , it was directly effective , and the rule was probably unjustified : having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice . The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 , because usually the state funds it , though higher education does not . Health care generally counts as a service . In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving ______ in Germany . The Dutch health authorities regarded the ______ unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom ( of the German health clinic ) to provide services . Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic , and should not fall within article 56 . But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government ( rather than the service recipient ) paid for the service . National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay , and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary . The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists , and this is also true in the context of the UK 's National Health Service . Aside from public services , another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal . Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption , including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists ( but not Dutch nationals ) going to coffee shops , fell outside article 56 altogether . The Court of Justice reasoned that ______ ______ were controlled in all member states , and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction . If an activity does fall within article 56 , a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice . In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures ( with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms ) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers . The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics , thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets . In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council . It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd , but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment . The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity , which underpinned the ban , did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services . In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling , and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services , was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people 's views were highly divergent . The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet . In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed .", "blank_classification": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"context_blanked": "In regard to companies , the Court of Justice held in R ( ______ ______ and General Trust plc ) v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business , without infringing TFEU article 49 . This meant the ______ ______ newspaper 's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK . The UK did not need to justify its action , as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised . By contrast , in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark 's minimum share capital rules . UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company , while Denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone ( around \u20ac 27,000 ) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent . The Court of Justice held that Denmark 's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd 's freedom of establishment and could not be justified , because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there , and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection . This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition , and a race to the bottom in standards , like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards , and low corporate taxes as a result . Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany . Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection , labour rights to participate in work , or the public interest in collecting taxes , denial of capacity went too far : it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment . However , in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law , they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose . This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary . Thus , the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies ( where restrictions must be justified ) , and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory , although it is not entirely clear why .", "blank_classification": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}], "title": "European_Union_law"}, {"paragraphs": [{"context_blanked": "______ ______ ______ ( Portuguese : Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia ; Spanish : Selva Amaz\u00f3nica , Amazon\u00eda or usually ______ ; French : For\u00eat amazonienne ; Dutch : ______ ) , also known in English as ______ or ______ ______ Jungle , is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of ______ ______ basin of South America .

But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model . Frame Relay does it at level two , the data link layer . Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted . Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes . X.25 does not define any ______ inside the packet network . It only operates at the user - network - ______ ( UNI ) . Thus , the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network . X.25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI , and its link layer ______ ( LAPB ) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures . Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN 's layer two ______ , LAPD and LAPB . As such , its integrity ______ pertain only between nodes on a link , not end - to - end . Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols . The X.25 UNI ______ is part of the X.25 ______ suite , which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model . It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s , to provide a ______ ______ into and out of packet networks . Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well , but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient . Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model . However , its address field ( the Data Link Connection ID , or DLCI ) can be used at the OSI network layer , with a minimum set of procedures . Thus , it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances , but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link ______ . The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25 . Because Frame relay is a data link layer ______ , like X.25 it does not define internal network routing ______ . For X.25 its packet IDs --- the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses . The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI . How this is done is up to the network provider . Frame Relay , by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two , by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode ( SABM ) . X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session , but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake . For a while , Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks . However , X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the ______ ______ ( IP ) at the network layer , and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) and or versions of Multi - ______ Label Switching ( MPLS ) at layer two .
