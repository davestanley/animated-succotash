Outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse , and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself . For instance , Whitehead was a teacher and long - time friend and collaborator of Bertrand Russell , and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine , both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy \u2013 the dominant strain of philosophy in English - speaking countries in the 20th century . Whitehead has also had high - profile admirers in the continental tradition , such as French post - structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze , who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that \" he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo - American philosopher before Wittgenstein 's disciples spread their misty confusion , sufficiency , and terror . \" French sociologist and anthropologist Bruno Latour even went so far as to call Whitehead \" the greatest philosopher of the 20th century . \"", "tags": "O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the general opinion of Whitehead in most philosophical schools?", "id": "57337e8f4776f41900660bc8", "answers": [{"text": "Whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools", "answer_start": 64}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "what is an example of Whitehead's ideas being counter-intuitive?", "id": "57337e8f4776f41900660bc9", "answers": [{"text": "his assertion that matter is an abstraction", "answer_start": 357}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a common opinion of metaphysics?", "id": "57337e8f4776f41900660bca", "answers": [{"text": "perception of metaphysics itself as pass\u00e9", "answer_start": 467}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why do some people believe Whitehead's writings may have restricted his influence?", "id": "57337e8f4776f41900660bcb", "answers": [{"text": "the sheer difficulty and density of his prose", "answer_start": 520}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "not been recognized as particularly influential", "answer_start": 78}], "question": "What is the general opinion of Whitehead in less philosophical schools?", "id": "5ad3d8e4604f3c001a3ff38b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "assertion that matter is an abstraction", "answer_start": 361}], "question": " what is an example of Whitehead's ideas not being counter-intuitive?", "id": "5ad3d8e4604f3c001a3ff38c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "metaphysics itself as pass\u00e9", "answer_start": 481}], "question": " What is an uncommon opinion of metaphysics?", "id": "5ad3d8e4604f3c001a3ff38d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "sheer difficulty and density of his prose", "answer_start": 524}], "question": "Why do some people believe Whitehead's writings may have not restricted his influence?", "id": "5ad3d8e4604f3c001a3ff38e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Deleuze's and Latour's opinions, however, are minority ones, as Whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools.
