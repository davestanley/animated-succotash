Rossano indicates that by including ever - watchful gods and spirits , humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups .", "tags": "O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "How did St. Anselm define the existence of God?", "id": "572867304b864d190016499e", "answers": [{"text": "\"that than which nothing greater can be conceived\"", "answer_start": 44}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who said that God is \"a substance consisting of infinite attributes\"?", "id": "572867304b864d190016499f", "answers": [{"text": "Baruch Spinoza", "answer_start": 124}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Baruch Spinoza use as proof for the existence of God?", "id": "572867304b864d19001649a0", "answers": [{"text": "a variation of the Ontological argument", "answer_start": 492}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Spinoza believe the world was made of?", "id": "572867304b864d19001649a1", "answers": [{"text": "one substance, God, or its equivalent, Nature", "answer_start": 406}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who defined god as \"that than which nothing greater can be conceived\"?", "id": "572c061cdfb02c14005c6b6d", "answers": [{"text": "St. Anselm", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Name a famous pantheist?", "id": "572c061cdfb02c14005c6b6e", "answers": [{"text": "Baruch Spinoza", "answer_start": 124}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was Spinoza's concept of God?", "id": "572c061cdfb02c14005c6b6f", "answers": [{"text": "infinite", "answer_start": 223}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Spinoza believed that the universe was made up of one substance which is?", "id": "572c061cdfb02c14005c6b70", "answers": [{"text": "God", "answer_start": 421}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "God, or its equivalent, Nature", "answer_start": 421}], "question": "What does St. Anselm believe the universe is comprised of?", "id": "5a3c88d4cc5d22001a521e00", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a variation of the Ontological argument", "answer_start": 492}], "question": "What does St. Anselm used to prove God's existence?", "id": "5a3c88d4cc5d22001a521e01", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "God", "answer_start": 36}], "question": "What does Baruch Spinoza believe nothing is greater than?", "id": "5a3c88d4cc5d22001a521e02", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "pantheist", "answer_start": 102}], "question": "What kind of philosopher is St Anselm?", "id": "5a3c88d4cc5d22001a521e03", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Baruch Spinoza", "answer_start": 124}], "question": "Who's idea about God did St. Anselm carry to its extreme?", "id": "5a3c88d4cc5d22001a521e04", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "St. Anselm's approach was to define God as, \"that than which nothing greater can be conceived\".
