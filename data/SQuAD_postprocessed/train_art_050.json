American intelligence agencies discovered that the Soviet Union had exploded its first atomic bomb , with the consequence that the United States potentially could face a future nuclear war that , for the first time , might devastate its cities . Given this new danger , the United States participated in an arms race with the Soviet Union that included development of the hydrogen bomb , as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) capable of delivering nuclear weapons . A new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the United States during the 1950s , which devolved into paranoid McCarthyism . With communism spreading in China , Korea , and Eastern Europe , Americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive \" witch - hunts \" to expose communist spies . Part of the American reaction to the Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large Air Force , under the control of the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) . SAC employed intercontinental strategic bombers , as well as medium - bombers based close to Soviet airspace ( in western Europe and in Turkey ) that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads .", "tags": "O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-LOC O U-LOC O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O U-ORG O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O U-LOC O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "How many casualties did the Soviet Union have during WWII?", "id": "56e08680231d4119001ac26b", "answers": [{"text": "27 million", "answer_start": 84}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Soviet Union was first invaded by Nazi controlled Germany in what year?", "id": "56e08680231d4119001ac26c", "answers": [{"text": "1941", "answer_start": 165}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Until what year, was the US the sole possessor of the atomic bomb?", "id": "56e08680231d4119001ac26d", "answers": [{"text": "1949", "answer_start": 253}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Stalin order the development of ICBMs?", "id": "56e08680231d4119001ac26e", "answers": [{"text": "1947", "answer_start": 624}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of military force did the US possess a much larger fleet than the Soviet Union?", "id": "56e08680231d4119001ac26f", "answers": [{"text": "air force", "answer_start": 514}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "For its part, the Soviet Union harbored fears of invasion.
