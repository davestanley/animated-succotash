By valuing diversity , employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population . By creating this diverse workforce , these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy . According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a \" company stronger , more profitable , and a better place to work . \" Therefore , these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination , but have shown the value in having diversity .", "tags": "O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does AAUP stand for?", "id": "572747fddd62a815002e9a78", "answers": [{"text": "American Association of University Professors", "answer_start": 42}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What were the effects of affirmative action on universities according to the study done by the AAUP?", "id": "572747fddd62a815002e9a79", "answers": [{"text": "positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of college students", "answer_start": 196}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did a study claim about the beliefs of faculty members on increased diversity?", "id": "572747fddd62a815002e9a7a", "answers": [{"text": "helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education", "answer_start": 442}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who supposedly suffers no detrimental effects from classroom diversity?", "id": "572747fddd62a815002e9a7b", "answers": [{"text": "Caucasian students", "answer_start": 510}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which year did the AAUP release their study?", "id": "572747fddd62a815002e9a7c", "answers": [{"text": "2000", "answer_start": 12}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "American Association of University Professors", "answer_start": 42}], "question": "What does ADUP stand for?", "id": "5ad4175f604f3c001a400393", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of college students as well as the teaching of faculty members", "answer_start": 196}], "question": "What were the effects of affirmative action on universities according to the study done by the AALP?", "id": "5ad4175f604f3c001a400394", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education", "answer_start": 442}], "question": "What did a study claim about the beliefs of faculty members on decreased diversity?", "id": "5ad4175f604f3c001a400395", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Caucasian students", "answer_start": 510}], "question": "Who supposedly suffers a lot of detrimental effects from classroom diversity?", "id": "5ad4175f604f3c001a400396", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2000", "answer_start": 1486}], "question": "In which year did the ALUP release their study?", "id": "5ad4175f604f3c001a400397", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In the year 2000, according to a study by American Association of University Professors (AAUP), affirmative action promoted diversity within colleges and universities.

Scholars such as Ronald Dworkin have asserted that no college applicant has a right to expect that a university will design its admissions policies in a way that prizes any particular set of qualities . In this view , admission is not an honor bestowed to reward superior merit but rather a way to advance the mission as each university defines it . If diversity is a goal of the university and their racial preferences do not discriminate against applicants based on hatred or contempt , then affirmative action can be judged acceptable based on the criteria related to the mission the university sets for itself .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did the ruling in Hopwood v Texas set a precedent for in terms of admission policies?", "id": "57276203f1498d1400e8f722", "answers": [{"text": "banning any use of race in school admissions", "answer_start": 46}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the law passed by the State of Texas guarantee?", "id": "57276203f1498d1400e8f723", "answers": [{"text": "entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of their graduating class", "answer_start": 137}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Other than Texas and Florida, which other state replaced racial quotas?", "id": "57276203f1498d1400e8f724", "answers": [{"text": "California", "answer_start": 243}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is one example of what racial quotas were replaced with?", "id": "57276203f1498d1400e8f725", "answers": [{"text": "class rank", "answer_start": 292}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "After the state passed the top 10% rule, what happened to minority enrollment?", "id": "57276203f1498d1400e8f726", "answers": [{"text": "returned minority enrollment to pre-1996 levels", "answer_start": 1189}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "banning any use of race in school admissions", "answer_start": 46}], "question": "What didn't the ruling in Hopwood v Texas set a precedent for in terms of admission policies?", "id": "5ad419f5604f3c001a400489", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of their graduating class", "answer_start": 137}], "question": " What did the law passed by the State of Texas not guarantee?", "id": "5ad419f5604f3c001a40048a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "California", "answer_start": 243}], "question": "Other than Texas and Florida, which other state did not replace racial quotas?", "id": "5ad419f5604f3c001a40048b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "class rank", "answer_start": 630}], "question": " What is one example of what racial quotas were not replaced with?", "id": "5ad419f5604f3c001a40048c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "To accommodate the ruling in Hopwood v.
