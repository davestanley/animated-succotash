As a result , the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution . The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes . There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts , but only three species of flowering plants , all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula : Deschampsia antarctica ( Antarctic hair grass ) , Colobanthus quitensis ( Antarctic pearlwort ) and the non - native Poa annua ( annual bluegrass ) .

This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent ( the polar vortex ) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole . As a result , the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures , and the peripheral areas of Antarctica , especially the Antarctic Peninsula , are subject to higher temperatures , which promote accelerated melting . Models also suggest that the ozone depletion / enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who has research stations in Antarctica?", "id": "570def870b85d914000d7c05", "answers": [{"text": "Several governments", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the span of population density per million square kilometers of researchers in Antarctica?", "id": "570def870b85d914000d7c06", "answers": [{"text": "between 70 and 350", "answer_start": 299}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "About long long do researchers stay when researching in Antarctica?", "id": "570def870b85d914000d7c07", "answers": [{"text": "one-year", "answer_start": 537}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What station has an Orthodox church representative?", "id": "570def870b85d914000d7c08", "answers": [{"text": "Bellingshausen Station", "answer_start": 623}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the Trinity Church begin its posting at Bellinshausen station?", "id": "570def870b85d914000d7c09", "answers": [{"text": "2004", "answer_start": 603}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Several governments", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Who maintains perminent settlements on the continent?", "id": "5ad25ca5d7d075001a428ec0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Trinity Church", "answer_start": 577}], "question": "What Antartcic Church closed in 2004?", "id": "5ad25ca5d7d075001a428ec1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "on the continent and its nearby islands", "answer_start": 164}], "question": "Where are there 5,000 year round residents?", "id": "5ad25ca5d7d075001a428ec2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1,000", "answer_start": 222}], "question": "How many people are conducting research on nearby islands in the winter?", "id": "5ad2bd17d7d075001a42a0b8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "5,000", "answer_start": 247}], "question": "How many people are conducting research on nearby islands in the summer?", "id": "5ad2bd17d7d075001a42a0b9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres", "answer_start": 299}], "question": "What is the population density of the surrounding islands?", "id": "5ad2bd17d7d075001a42a0ba", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2004", "answer_start": 603}], "question": "What year did Trinity Orthodox open?", "id": "5ad2bd17d7d075001a42a0bb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Russian Bellingshausen Station", "answer_start": 615}], "question": "What station opened Trinity Orthodox?", "id": "5ad2bd17d7d075001a42a0bc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Several governments maintain permanent manned research stations on the continent.
