In Japanese , it was originally recorded in the Nara Period as a verb * samorapu ( \" to watch , to keep watch , to observe , to be on the lookout for something ; to serve , to attend \" ) , which is believed to be derived from the frequentative form ( * morapu \u5b88\u3089\u3075 ) of the verb moru ( \u5b88\u308b , \" to watch , to guard , to be on the lookout ; to keep , to protect , to take care of , to be in charge of , to have as one 's ward \" ) . By the Heian period , this word had developed into the verb saburahu ( \u3055\u3076\u3089\u3075 , \" to serve , to attend \" ) , from which a deverbal noun saburahi ( \u3055\u3076\u3089\u3072 , \" servant , attendant \" ) was later derived , and this noun then yielded samurahi ( \u3055\u3080\u3089\u3072 ) in the Edo period . In Japanese literature , there is an early reference to samurai in the Kokinsh\u016b ( \u53e4\u4eca\u96c6 , early 10th century ) :", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O U-MISC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who were the bushi class?", "id": "5728fd38af94a219006a9edb", "answers": [{"text": "ancient Japanese soldiers from traditional warrior families", "answer_start": 32}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where did the bushi live?", "id": "5728fd38af94a219006a9edc", "answers": [{"text": "mainly in the north of Japan", "answer_start": 123}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where did the imperial family live?", "id": "5728fd38af94a219006a9edd", "answers": [{"text": "Kyoto", "answer_start": 312}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does Bushido mean?", "id": "5728fd38af94a219006a9ede", "answers": [{"text": "the \"way of the warrior\"", "answer_start": 444}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was a bukeyashiki?", "id": "5728fd38af94a219006a9edf", "answers": [{"text": "the mansion of a warrior", "answer_start": 500}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Bushi was the name given to the ancient Japanese soldiers from traditional warrior families.
