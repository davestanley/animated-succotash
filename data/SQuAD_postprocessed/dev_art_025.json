The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between \" cellular \" and \" humoral \" theories of immunity . According to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff , it was cells \u2013 more precisely , phagocytes \u2013 that were responsible for immune responses . In contrast , the humoral theory of immunity , held , among others , by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components ( molecules ) found in the organism \u2019s \u201c humors \u201d rather than its cells .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Tumors that are able to evade the body's immune response can become what?", "id": "572a0b0b6aef0514001551f6", "answers": [{"text": "cancers", "answer_start": 65}, {"text": "cancers", "answer_start": 65}, {"text": "cancers", "answer_start": 65}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What receptors do tumor cells often have reduced concentrations of?", "id": "572a0b0b6aef0514001551f7", "answers": [{"text": "MHC class I molecules", "answer_start": 117}, {"text": "MHC class I", "answer_start": 117}, {"text": "MHC class I molecules", "answer_start": 117}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a chemical secreted by tumors that suppresses the immune response?", "id": "572a0b0b6aef0514001551f8", "answers": [{"text": "cytokine TGF-\u03b2", "answer_start": 302}, {"text": "cytokine TGF-\u03b2", "answer_start": 302}, {"text": "cytokine TGF-\u03b2", "answer_start": 302}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Cytokine TBF-B suppresses the activity of what cell types?", "id": "572a0b0b6aef0514001551f9", "answers": [{"text": "macrophages and lymphocytes", "answer_start": 351}, {"text": "macrophages and lymphocytes", "answer_start": 351}, {"text": "macrophages and lymphocytes", "answer_start": 351}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "some tumors", "answer_start": 9}], "question": "What is unable to evade the immune system?", "id": "5ad4e56d5b96ef001a10a598", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "reduced number of MHC class I molecules", "answer_start": 99}], "question": "What makes detection by killer T cells more likely?", "id": "5ad4e56d5b96ef001a10a599", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cytokine TGF-\u03b2", "answer_start": 302}], "question": "What do tumor cells release that strengthens the immune response?", "id": "5ad4e56d5b96ef001a10a59a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "macrophages and lymphocytes", "answer_start": 351}], "question": "What does cytokine TGF-\u03b2 encourage the activity of?", "id": "5ad4e56d5b96ef001a10a59b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells", "answer_start": 460}], "question": "What happens when the immune system loses tolerance for tumor antigens?", "id": "5ad4e56d5b96ef001a10a59c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Clearly, some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers.

The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources ; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus , which causes cervical cancer , while others are the organism 's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells . One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that , when expressed at high levels , transforms certain skin cells ( e.g. melanocytes ) into tumors called melanomas . A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival , that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "At what size and larger can drugs elicit a neutralizing immune response?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155222", "answers": [{"text": ">500 Da", "answer_start": 14}, {"text": ">500 Da", "answer_start": 14}, {"text": ">500 Da", "answer_start": 14}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155223", "answers": [{"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}, {"text": "hydrophilic", "answer_start": 749}, {"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the study of proteins involved in immune response known as?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155224", "answers": [{"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1257}, {"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1257}, {"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1257}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "There is a public database of epitopes for pathogens known to be recognizable by what cells?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155225", "answers": [{"text": "B cells", "answer_start": 1142}, {"text": "B", "answer_start": 1142}, {"text": "B cells", "answer_start": 1142}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the field of studying immunogenicity through bioinformatics known as?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155226", "answers": [{"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1238}, {"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1238}, {"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1238}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "neutralizing", "answer_start": 37}], "question": "What kind of immune response do smaller drugs provoke?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a758", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "limits the effectiveness", "answer_start": 147}], "question": "What does the neutralizing immune response mean for drugs based on smaller peptides and proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a759", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Computational methods", "answer_start": 406}], "question": "What is not a way that is used to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}], "question": "What is underrepresented in epitope regions?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1257}], "question": "What is the study of small sets of proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses.
