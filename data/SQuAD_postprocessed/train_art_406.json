Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from center outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly.

Moulting is annual in most species , although some may have two moults a year , and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years . Moulting patterns vary across species . In passerines , flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first . When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced , the outermost tertiaries begin to drop . After the innermost tertiaries are moulted , the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers ( centrifugal moult ) . The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap . A small number of species , such as ducks and geese , lose all of their flight feathers at once , temporarily becoming flightless . As a general rule , the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair . Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae . The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers , in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail .
