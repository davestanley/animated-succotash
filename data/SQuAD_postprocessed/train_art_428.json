The paradoxical effect is that , the harder policing agencies work to produce security , the greater are feelings of insecurity .", "tags": "O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where has transnational policing become more important?", "id": "5732baf1328d981900602035", "answers": [{"text": "in United Nations peacekeeping", "answer_start": 201}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of countries get assistance with policing?", "id": "5732baf1328d981900602036", "answers": [{"text": "weak, failed or failing states", "answer_start": 26}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who wrote about police development-aid in 2007?", "id": "5732baf1328d981900602037", "answers": [{"text": "Goldsmith and Sheptycki", "answer_start": 423}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What concern did Hills raise about police models?", "id": "5732baf1328d981900602038", "answers": [{"text": "there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions", "answer_start": 564}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What concern did Hills raise about power imbalances?", "id": "5732baf1328d981900602039", "answers": [{"text": "With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark", "answer_start": 454}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "in United Nations peacekeeping", "answer_start": 201}], "question": "Where has transnational policing become less important?", "id": "5acecc9332bba1001ae4b47d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "weak, failed or failing states", "answer_start": 26}], "question": "What kind of countries get no assistance with policing?", "id": "5acecc9332bba1001ae4b47e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Goldsmith and Sheptycki", "answer_start": 423}], "question": "Who wrote about police development-aid in 2006?", "id": "5acecc9332bba1001ae4b47f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions", "answer_start": 564}], "question": "What concern did Hills ignore about police models?", "id": "5acecc9332bba1001ae4b480", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark", "answer_start": 454}], "question": "What concern did Hills ignore about power imbalances?", "id": "5acecc9332bba1001ae4b481", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Police development-aid to weak, failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention.
