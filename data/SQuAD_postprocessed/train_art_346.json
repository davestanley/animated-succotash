The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to 12 men per side , introduced the Snap - Back system , required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs , eliminated the Throw - In from the sidelines , allowed only six men on the line , stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks . The rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country . The CIRFU , QRFU and CRU refused to adopt the new rules at first . Forward passes were not allowed in the Canadian game until 1929 , and touchdowns , which had been five points , were increased to six points in 1956 , in both cases several decades after the Americans had adopted the same changes . The primary differences between the Canadian and American games stem from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not ( originally , both sides had three downs , goal posts on the goal lines and unlimited forward motion , but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not ) .
