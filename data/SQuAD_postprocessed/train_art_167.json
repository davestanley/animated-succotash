Assuming this reference point the linkage disequilibrium in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was interpreted as \" matches signs of interbreeding or ' admixture ' between Middle Eastern and European populations \" . On the Bray et al . tree , Ashkenazi Jews were found to be a genetically more divergent population than Russians , Orcadians , French , Basques , Italians , Sardinians and Tuscans . The study also observed that Ashkenazim are more diverse than their Middle Eastern relatives , which was counterintuitive because Ashkenazim are supposed to be a subset , not a superset , of their assumed geographical source population . Bray et al . therefore postulate that these results reflect not the population antiquity but a history of mixing between genetically distinct populations in Europe . However , it 's possible that the relaxation of marriage prescription in the ancestors of Ashkenazim that drove their heterozygosity up , while the maintenance of the FBD rule in native Middle Easterners have been keeping their heterozygosity values in check . Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray et al . study , therefore , may come from their ethnic endogamy ( ethnic inbreeding ) , which allowed them to \" mine \" their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors , and not from clan endogamy ( clan inbreeding ) . Consequently , their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter 's marriage practices , not necessarily from the former 's admixture with Europeans .", "tags": "O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-MISC O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O U-MISC O U-MISC O U-MISC O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Genetic studies on Ashkenazim have found a significant prevalence of what type of origins?", "id": "571a6c094faf5e1900b8a998", "answers": [{"text": "ancient Levantine origins", "answer_start": 266}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Have studies on the genetics of the Ashkenazim come to similar or divergent conclusions regarding the degree and sources of their European ancestry?", "id": "571a6c094faf5e1900b8a999", "answers": [{"text": "they have arrived at diverging conclusions", "answer_start": 297}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Have these studies on Ashkenazim genetics researched their paternal lineages, maternal lineages, or both?", "id": "571a6c094faf5e1900b8a99a", "answers": [{"text": "researching both their paternal and maternal lineages", "answer_start": 175}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Genetic studies on the Ashkenazim have tried to determine how much of their ancestry is derived from European populations and from where?", "id": "571a6c094faf5e1900b8a99b", "answers": [{"text": "the Levant", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Genetic studies on Ashkenazim have been conducted to determine how much of their ancestry comes from the Levant, and how much derives from European populations.

The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large - scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry \" , as both groups \u2013 the Middle Eastern Jews and European / Syrian Jews \u2013 shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago . The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups ( Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi ) share large swaths of DNA , indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study ( Iranian , Iraqi , Syrian , Italian , Turkish , Greek and Ashkenazi ) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non - Jewish countrymen . Atzmon 's team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non - Jews . Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews . The study also found that with respect to non - Jewish European groups , the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern - day Italians . The study speculated that the genetic - similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be due to inter - marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire .
