Of the many silica - based glasses that exist , ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called soda - lime glass , composed of approximately 75 % silicon dioxide ( SiO2 ) , sodium oxide ( Na2O ) from sodium carbonate ( Na2CO3 ) , calcium oxide , also called lime ( CaO ) , and several minor additives . A very clear and durable quartz glass can be made from pure silica , but the high melting point and very narrow glass transition of quartz make glassblowing and hot working difficult . In glasses like soda lime , the compounds added to quartz are used to lower the melting temperature and improve workability , at a cost in the toughness , thermal stability , and optical transmittance .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does glass lack, allowing it to be transparent?", "id": "572927efaf94a219006aa117", "answers": [{"text": "internal subdivisions", "answer_start": 367}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What force gives glass its surface texture?", "id": "572927efaf94a219006aa118", "answers": [{"text": "surface tension", "answer_start": 698}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What, in contrast to glass, doesn't let light pass through?", "id": "572927efaf94a219006aa119", "answers": [{"text": "polycrystalline materials", "answer_start": 131}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of glass absorbs some light?", "id": "572927efaf94a219006aa11a", "answers": [{"text": "colored", "answer_start": 878}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "internal subdivisions", "answer_start": 367}], "question": "What does glass lack, allowing it to be polycrystalline?", "id": "5a66f904f038b7001ab0c13a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "surface tension", "answer_start": 698}], "question": "What force gives glass its rigid crystal geometries?", "id": "5a66f904f038b7001ab0c13b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "polycrystalline materials", "answer_start": 131}], "question": "What, in contrast to glass, doesn't absorb light?", "id": "5a66f904f038b7001ab0c13c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "colored", "answer_start": 878}], "question": "What type of glass absorbs molecules of supercooled liquid?", "id": "5a66f904f038b7001ab0c13d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "internal subdivisions", "answer_start": 367}], "question": "What do individual crystallites not contain?", "id": "5a66f904f038b7001ab0c13e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light.
