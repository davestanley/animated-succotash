The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio , which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century , although it was restored many times later . The baptistery of the basilica , which was demolished in the 15th century , had a vault covered with gold - leaf tesserae , large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated . In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro , now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio , every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century . Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome , while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background .

Well - known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the Basilica di San Clemente , the fa\u00e7ade of Santa Maria in Trastevere and San Paolo fuori le Mura . The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere ( 1140 ) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne , the first example of this iconographic scheme . A similar mosaic , the Coronation of the Virgin , decorates the apse of Santa Maria Maggiore . It is a work of Jacopo Torriti from 1295 . The mosaics of Torriti and Jacopo da Camerino in the apse of San Giovanni in Laterano from 1288\u201394 were thoroughly restored in 1884 . The apse mosaic of San Crisogono is attributed to Pietro Cavallini , the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century . Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290 . These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective . There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of San Tommaso in Formis showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave . The church belonged to the Order of the Trinitarians which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves .", "tags": "O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O O O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-LOC O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O B-PER L-PER O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who created the Navicella mosaic in the Old St. Peter's church?", "id": "57316811e6313a140071cefc", "answers": [{"text": "Giotto di Bondone", "answer_start": 93}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who commissioned the Navicella mosaic?", "id": "57316811e6313a140071cefd", "answers": [{"text": "Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi", "answer_start": 146}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did the navicella mosaic depict walking on water?", "id": "57316811e6313a140071cefe", "answers": [{"text": "St. Peter", "answer_start": 328}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What century was the majority of the Navicella mosaic destroyed?", "id": "57316811e6313a140071ceff", "answers": [{"text": "the 17th", "answer_start": 456}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Navicella means what in Italian?", "id": "57316811e6313a140071cf00", "answers": [{"text": "\"little ship\"", "answer_start": 490}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The great Navicella mosaic (1305\u20131313) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter's is attributed to Giotto di Bondone.
