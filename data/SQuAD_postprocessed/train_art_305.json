For Popper , theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process . Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not ; the more generally applicable a theory is , the greater its value . Thus Newton 's laws , with their wide general application , are to be preferred over the much more specific \" the solar system has seven planets\".[dubious \u2013 discuss ]", "tags": "O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Popper believed he had already discussed similar ideas to Kuhn's about scientific communities in what work?", "id": "5728de173acd2414000e00b5", "answers": [{"text": "Logic of Discovery", "answer_start": 69}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What aspect of Kuhn's thinking did Popper criticize?", "id": "5728de173acd2414000e00b6", "answers": [{"text": "relativism", "answer_start": 339}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Popper say must be the beginning phase of science?", "id": "5728de173acd2414000e00b7", "answers": [{"text": "the critical discussion of myths", "answer_start": 635}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "According to Popper, what second layer does scientific inquiry have that pre-scientific inquiry does not?", "id": "5728de173acd2414000e00b8", "answers": [{"text": "a critical attitude", "answer_start": 874}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1934", "answer_start": 49}], "question": "What year did Kuhn stress \"that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework\"?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a42954e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Logic of Discovery", "answer_start": 69}], "question": "What book did Kuhn publish in 1934?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a42954f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "relativism", "answer_start": 339}], "question": "What did Kuhn criticize about Popper?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a429550", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the critical discussion of myths", "answer_start": 635}], "question": "What did Kuhn say must be the beginning phase of science?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a429551", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a critical attitude", "answer_start": 874}], "question": "According to Kuhn, what second layer does scientific inquiry have that pre-scientific inquiry does not?", "id": "5ad2780cd7d075001a429552", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Popper claimed to have recognised already in the 1934 version of his Logic of Discovery a fact later stressed by Kuhn, \"that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework\", and to that extent to have anticipated Kuhn's central point about \"normal science\".

For , according to Popper , Einstein 's theory was at least equally as well corroborated as Newton 's upon its initial conception ; they both equally well accounted for all the hitherto available evidence . Moreover , since Einstein also explained the empirical refutations of Newton 's theory , general relativity was immediately deemed suitable for tentative acceptance on the Popperian account .
