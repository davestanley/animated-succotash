Bedau writes , \" There is a whole class of acts , undertaken in the name of civil disobedience , which , even if they were widely practiced , would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance ( e.g. trespassing at a nuclear - missile installation) ... Such acts are often just a harassment and , at least to the bystander , somewhat inane ... The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity . \" Bedau also notes , though , that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose . Some civil disobedients , such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness , which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government , directly achieve a desired social goal ( such as the provision of medication to the sick ) while openly breaking the law .

Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law , and then wins his case , then that act did not constitute civil disobedience . It has also been argued that breaking the law for self - gratification , as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law , is not civil disobedience . Likewise , a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution , or by denying having committed the crime , or by fleeing the jurisdiction , is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is violating a law which is not the goal of the protest called?", "id": "5728fc9e1d04691400778f11", "answers": [{"text": "Indirect civil disobedience", "answer_start": 68}, {"text": "Indirect civil disobedience", "answer_start": 68}, {"text": "Indirect civil disobedience", "answer_start": 68}, {"text": "Indirect civil disobedience", "answer_start": 68}, {"text": "Indirect civil disobedience", "answer_start": 68}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When the law is a direct target of the protest, what is this called?", "id": "5728fc9e1d04691400778f12", "answers": [{"text": "direct civil disobedience", "answer_start": 174}, {"text": "direct civil disobedience", "answer_start": 174}, {"text": "direct civil disobedience", "answer_start": 174}, {"text": "direct civil disobedience", "answer_start": 174}, {"text": "direct civil disobedience", "answer_start": 174}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What US war caused a high amount of civil disobedience?", "id": "5728fc9e1d04691400778f13", "answers": [{"text": "Vietnam War", "answer_start": 443}, {"text": "Vietnam War", "answer_start": 288}, {"text": "Vietnam War", "answer_start": 443}, {"text": "Vietnam War", "answer_start": 443}, {"text": "Vietnam", "answer_start": 288}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of defense is sometimes used in court by protestors?", "id": "5728fc9e1d04691400778f14", "answers": [{"text": "competing harms defense", "answer_start": 1035}, {"text": "necessity defense", "answer_start": 506}, {"text": "necessity defense", "answer_start": 506}, {"text": "necessity", "answer_start": 506}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why are people who distribute leaflets inside courthouses not been arrested?", "id": "5728fc9e1d04691400778f15", "answers": [{"text": "the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence", "answer_start": 1377}, {"text": "if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence", "answer_start": 1330}, {"text": "the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence", "answer_start": 1377}, {"text": "the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence", "answer_start": 1377}, {"text": "the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence", "answer_start": 1377}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "by breaking that law", "answer_start": 254}], "question": "What does indirect civil disobedience protest a law by doing?", "id": "5a66a156f038b7001ab0c072", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "violating a law", "answer_start": 105}], "question": "What does direct civil disobedience do to the law that isn't being protested?", "id": "5a66a156f038b7001ab0c073", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Fully Informed Jury Association activists", "answer_start": 1085}], "question": "Who passed out educational leaflets in courtrooms during the Vietnam War?", "id": "5a66a156f038b7001ab0c074", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "educational leaflets", "answer_start": 1153}], "question": "What did Carter Wentworth hand out in court to escape prosecution?", "id": "5a66a156f038b7001ab0c075", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence", "answer_start": 1377}], "question": "If he was arrested, what would happen to the leaflets that were handed out by Carter Wentworth in court", "id": "5a66a156f038b7001ab0c076", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: \"Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.\" During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question.
