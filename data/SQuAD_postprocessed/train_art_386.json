Either tunnel, at 50 mi (80 km), would be by far the longest in the world, and would cost an estimated \u00a315 billion or \u20ac20 billion. A proposal in 2007, estimated the cost of building a bridge from County Antrim in Northern Ireland to Galloway in Scotland at \u00a33.5bn (\u20ac5bn).", "allenNER": {"words": "The idea of building a tunnel under the Irish Sea has been raised since 1895 , when it was first investigated .
