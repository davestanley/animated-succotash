For Nagarjuna, it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of \u0101tman; all phenomena (dharmas) are without any svabhava (literally \"own-nature\" or \"self-nature\"), and thus without any underlying essence; they are \"empty\" of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as the M\u0101dhyamaka. Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the agamas. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the Canon.

Nagarjuna 's primary contribution to Buddhist philosophy was the systematic exposition of the concept of \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 , or \" emptiness \" , widely attested in the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras that emerged in his era . The concept of emptiness brings together other key Buddhist doctrines , particularly anatta and dependent origination , to refute the metaphysics of Sarvastivada and Sautrantika ( extinct non - Mahayana schools ) . For Nagarjuna , it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of \u0101tman ; all phenomena ( dharmas ) are without any svabhava ( literally \" own - nature \" or \" self - nature \" ) , and thus without any underlying essence ; they are \" empty \" of being independent ; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism . Nagarjuna 's school of thought is known as the M\u0101dhyamaka . Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts , but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the agamas .

Initially it was known as Bodhisattvay\u0101na ( the \" Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas \" ) . Paul Williams has also noted that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism , and therefore each bhik\u1e63u or bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b adhering to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na formally belonged to an early school . This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia , and the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism . Therefore Mah\u0101y\u0101na was never a separate rival sect of the early schools . From Chinese monks visiting India , we now know that both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and non - Mah\u0101y\u0101na monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side .", "tags": "O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O U-MISC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O U-MISC O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O U-LOC O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Most of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mhayana comes from what type of translations?", "id": "56d2706859d6e41400145fdc", "answers": [{"text": "Chinese", "answer_start": 79}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Mahayana teachings were first propagated into China by who?", "id": "56d2706859d6e41400145fdd", "answers": [{"text": "Lokak\u1e63ema", "answer_start": 180}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The earliest Mahayana sutras included the very first versions of what series?", "id": "56d2706859d6e41400145fde", "answers": [{"text": "Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101", "answer_start": 395}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Texts concerning Aksobhya Buddha were probably composed in what century BCE?", "id": "56d2706859d6e41400145fdf", "answers": [{"text": "1st", "answer_start": 499}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mah\u0101y\u0101na comes from early Chinese translations of Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts.
