Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium \" natural state \" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the \" natural state of rest \" . That is , the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity . By making rest physically indistinguishable from non - zero constant velocity , Newton 's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities .

For example , friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms , but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector . Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces , tension , compression , and drag . However , for any sufficiently detailed description , all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what treatment are nonconservative and conservative forces described?", "id": "5737a9afc3c5551400e51f61", "answers": [{"text": "statistical mechanics", "answer_start": 134}, {"text": "statistical mechanics", "answer_start": 134}, {"text": "detailed", "answer_start": 110}, {"text": "detailed treatment with statistical mechanics", "answer_start": 110}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What changes macroscopic closed system energies?", "id": "5737a9afc3c5551400e51f62", "answers": [{"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "internal energies of the system", "answer_start": 229}, {"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the exchange of heat associated with?", "id": "5737a9afc3c5551400e51f63", "answers": [{"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the law of thermodynamics associated with closed system heat exchange?", "id": "5737a9afc3c5551400e51f64", "answers": [{"text": "Second", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "Second law of thermodynamics", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "Second law", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "Second", "answer_start": 331}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What makes energy changes in a closed system?", "id": "5737a9afc3c5551400e51f65", "answers": [{"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 361}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "change the internal energies of the system", "answer_start": 218}], "question": "In macroscopic open systems, non conservative forces act to do what?", "id": "5ad28a57d7d075001a4299b0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}], "question": "What are often associated with the transfer of cold?", "id": "5ad28a57d7d075001a4299b1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "heat", "answer_start": 308}], "question": "Conservative forces are often associated with the transfer of what?", "id": "5ad28a57d7d075001a4299b2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "nonconservative forces", "answer_start": 188}], "question": "What does not change macroscopic closed systems?", "id": "5ad28a57d7d075001a4299b3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics.
