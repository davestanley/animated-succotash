Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high - voltage capacitors , for instance using a Brinkley stick . Capacitors may also have built - in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed . High - voltage capacitors are stored with the terminals shorted , as protection from potentially dangerous voltages due to dielectric absorption or from transient voltages the capacitor may pick up from static charges or passing weather events .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What could cause the failure of a capacitor?", "id": "5727247c5951b619008f8669", "answers": [{"text": "when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating", "answer_start": 37}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What can happen to capacitors used in high current applications?", "id": "5727247c5951b619008f866a", "answers": [{"text": "overheat", "answer_start": 363}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What can happen to capacitors used in high energy capacitor banks?", "id": "5727247c5951b619008f866b", "answers": [{"text": "violently explode", "answer_start": 477}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of capacitors can generate soft x-rays?", "id": "5727247c5951b619008f866c", "answers": [{"text": "High voltage vacuum capacitors", "answer_start": 611}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is one way to help minimize capacitor dangers?", "id": "5727247c5951b619008f866d", "answers": [{"text": "preventive maintenance", "answer_start": 729}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating", "answer_start": 37}], "question": "What couldn't cause the failure of a capacitor?", "id": "5acf928b77cf76001a6852de", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "overheat", "answer_start": 363}], "question": " What can't happen to capacitors used in high current applications?", "id": "5acf928b77cf76001a6852df", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "violently explode", "answer_start": 477}], "question": "What can happen to capacitors used in low energy capacitor banks?", "id": "5acf928b77cf76001a6852e0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "High voltage vacuum capacitors", "answer_start": 611}], "question": " What type of capacitors can generate hard x-rays?", "id": "5acf928b77cf76001a6852e1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "preventive maintenance", "answer_start": 729}], "question": " What is one way to help maximize capacitor dangers?", "id": "5acf928b77cf76001a6852e2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life.
