The first commercially successful DC motors followed the invention by Z\u00e9nobe Gramme who , in 1871 , reinvented Pacinotti 's design . In 1873 , Gramme showed that his dynamo could be used as a motor , which he demonstrated to great effect at exhibitions in Vienna and Philadelphia by connecting two such DC motors at a distance of up to 2 km away from each other , one as a generator .
