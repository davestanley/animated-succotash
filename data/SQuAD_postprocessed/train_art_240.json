They are mostly traditional , upright , steel - framed bicycles , with few or no gears . There are also barrow bikes , for carrying shopping or small children . As thousands of bicycles are parked haphazardly in town , creating an eyesore but also impeding pedestrians , the City Council decided in 2014 to build the world 's largest bicycle parking station , near the Central Railway Station .
