Napoleon ultimately took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the mesures usuelles ( traditional units of measurement ) for retail trade \u2014 a system of measure that resembled the pre - revolutionary units but were based on the kilogram and the metre ; for example the livre metrique ( metric pound ) was 500 g instead of 489.5 g \u2014 the value of the livre du roi ( the king 's pound ) . Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner . This however laid the foundations for the definitive introduction of the metric system across Europe in the middle of the 19th century .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-MISC O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What acts by Napoleon laid the groundwork for modernized Education in France and much of Europe?", "id": "5726ebd5708984140094d605", "answers": [{"text": "Napoleon's educational reforms", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What language did Napoleon make the only official one?", "id": "5726ebd5708984140094d606", "answers": [{"text": "French", "answer_start": 320}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Napoleon offer to secondary education?", "id": "5726ebd5708984140094d607", "answers": [{"text": "public support", "answer_start": 435}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name for the state secondary schools begun by Napoleon that were intended to standardize education across France?", "id": "5726ebd5708984140094d608", "answers": [{"text": "lyc\u00e9es", "answer_start": 528}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with modern and classical languages, what were all students in the lyc\u00e9es taught?", "id": "5726ebd5708984140094d609", "answers": [{"text": "the sciences", "answer_start": 638}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Napoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in France and throughout much of Europe.
