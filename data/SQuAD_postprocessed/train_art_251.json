In 1843 and 1844 , sailing ships bringing immigrant families from Alsace arrived at the port of New York . Some settled in Illinois , many to farm or to seek success in commercial ventures : for example , the sailing ships Sully ( in May 1843 ) and Iowa ( in June 1844 ) brought families who set up homes in northern Illinois and northern Indiana . Some Alsatian immigrants were noted for their roles in 19th - century American economic development . Others ventured to Canada to settle in southwestern Ontario , notably Waterloo County .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-LOC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O U-LOC O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-LOC O O B-LOC L-LOC O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What was the population of Alsace in 1790?", "id": "57278f23708984140094e0d7", "answers": [{"text": "22,500", "answer_start": 59}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Jews were banned from cities in Alsace, where were they forced to settle?", "id": "57278f23708984140094e0d8", "answers": [{"text": "in villages", "answer_start": 405}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "in 1791 Jews were granted what by the French?", "id": "57278f23708984140094e0d9", "answers": [{"text": "full emancipation", "answer_start": 604}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country was Alsace merged into during  1871-1918", "id": "57278f23708984140094e0da", "answers": [{"text": "Germany", "answer_start": 1144}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Napoleon", "answer_start": 678}], "question": "Who decreased antisemitism in 1806?", "id": "5a6fdbdd8abb0b001a675fbf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "22,500", "answer_start": 59}], "question": "What was the Jewish population in 1831?", "id": "5a6fdbdd8abb0b001a675fc0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "3%", "answer_start": 73}], "question": "What percentage of the population was anti-Jewish in 1790?", "id": "5a6fdbdd8abb0b001a675fc1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Germany", "answer_start": 1144}], "question": "Who did Alsace separate from in 1871?", "id": "5a6fdbdd8abb0b001a675fc2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "trade, services, and especially in money lending", "answer_start": 439}], "question": "What was the primary job of rabbis?", "id": "5a6fdbdd8abb0b001a675fc3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "By 1790, the Jewish population of Alsace was approximately 22,500, about 3% of the provincial population.
