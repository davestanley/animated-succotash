Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs . A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association 's \" Rational Clinical Examination Series \" quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection . The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( LR ) range , 11 - 20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0.64 - 0.88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary LR 0.64 - 0.88 ) .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Disease can arise when an organism inflicts what on the host?", "id": "57341fdd4776f419006618d3", "answers": [{"text": "damage", "answer_start": 103}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What can a microorganism cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of?", "id": "57341fdd4776f419006618d4", "answers": [{"text": "toxins", "answer_start": 188}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does the of toxin Clostridium tetani releases do?", "id": "57341fdd4776f419006618d5", "answers": [{"text": "paralyzes muscles", "answer_start": 273}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What releases toxins which product shock and sepsis?", "id": "57341fdd4776f419006618d6", "answers": [{"text": "staphylococcus", "answer_start": 296}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What percentage of people infected with polio develop disease?", "id": "57341fdd4776f419006618d7", "answers": [{"text": "less than 5%", "answer_start": 425}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "damage", "answer_start": 103}], "question": "When an organism prevents what from the host a disease can arise?", "id": "5a82fa8ae60761001a2eb29f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "toxins", "answer_start": 188}], "question": "What can a microorganism repair tissue damage by releasing a variety of?", "id": "5a82fa8ae60761001a2eb2a0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "paralyzes muscles", "answer_start": 273}], "question": "What does the toxin Clostridium tetani release help avoid?", "id": "5a82fa8ae60761001a2eb2a1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "staphylococcus", "answer_start": 296}], "question": "What releases toxins which produce joy and euphoria?", "id": "5a82fa8ae60761001a2eb2a2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "mad cow disease", "answer_start": 571}], "question": "What disease similarly to Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob has never resulted in death?", "id": "5a82fa8ae60761001a2eb2a3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Disease can arise if the host's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host.
