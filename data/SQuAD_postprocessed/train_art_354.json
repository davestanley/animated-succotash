Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent the risk of an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train.

This is achieved by Neutral Sections ( also known as Phase Breaks ) , usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although , typically , only half are in use at any time , the others being provided to allow a feeder station to be shut down and power provided from adjacent feeder stations . Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material , typically ceramic beads , designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other . The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other , as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow . To prevent the risk of an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth , when passing through the neutral section , the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open . In many cases , this is done manually by the drivers . To help them , a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before . A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re - close the circuit breaker , although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board . In the UK , a system known as Automatic Power Control ( APC ) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker , this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train . The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What nowdays electrification systems can use?", "id": "572f591404bcaa1900d76889", "answers": [{"text": "DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors", "answer_start": 187}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the main action AC and DC systems have to deal with?", "id": "572f591404bcaa1900d7688a", "answers": [{"text": "converting and transporting", "answer_start": 388}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of losses happen during conversion and transmission in wires and electronics?", "id": "572f591404bcaa1900d7688b", "answers": [{"text": "ohmic losses", "answer_start": 736}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of losses take place in transformers and inductors during conversion/transmission process?", "id": "572f591404bcaa1900d7688c", "answers": [{"text": "magnetic field losses", "answer_start": 781}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a power grid", "answer_start": 51}], "question": "Modern electrification systems take DC energy from what?", "id": "5acd89fe07355d001abf466c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC", "answer_start": 278}], "question": "4-phase AC motors require further what?", "id": "5acd89fe07355d001abf466d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the transmission and conversion of electric energy", "answer_start": 669}], "question": "What doesn't involve losses?", "id": "5acd89fe07355d001abf466e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "railway substation", "answer_start": 912}], "question": "Power conversion for an AC system takes place mainly in a what?", "id": "5acd89fe07355d001abf466f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "accounted for", "answer_start": 1266}], "question": "The energy used to blow air to heat transformers must be what?", "id": "5acd89fe07355d001abf4670", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a DC voltage to be used by traction motors.
