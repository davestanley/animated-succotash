The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be un-original, hence establishing a \"critical text\", or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition.
