These students became known as Oppidans , from the Latin word oppidum , meaning town . The Houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner , and during the 18th and 19th centuries were mostly run by women known as \" dames \" . They typically contain about fifty boys . Although classes are organised on a School basis , most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their House . Each House has a formal name , mainly used for post and people outside the Eton community . It is generally known by the boys by the initials or surname of the House Master , the teacher who lives in the house and manages the pupils in it .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "If a boy elects to live in an Oppidan house instead of the College house, what are they called?", "id": "5727ba063acd2414000deaaf", "answers": [{"text": "Oppidan Scholars", "answer_start": 173}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which students are allowed to use the letters OS after their name?", "id": "5727ba063acd2414000deab0", "answers": [{"text": "Oppidan Scholar", "answer_start": 450}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many Oppidan houses are at Eaton?", "id": "5727ba063acd2414000deab1", "answers": [{"text": "24", "answer_start": 136}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under what circumstances are Oppidan Scholarships awarded?", "id": "5727ba063acd2414000deab2", "answers": [{"text": "consistently performing with distinction in School and external examinations", "answer_start": 236}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many distinguishments does a student need for an Oppidan Scholarship?", "id": "5727ba063acd2414000deab3", "answers": [{"text": "either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career", "answer_start": 362}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "three distinctions in a row", "answer_start": 369}], "question": "What is one of the requirements to be a King's Scholar?", "id": "5ad21429d7d075001a428378", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "OS", "answer_start": 497}], "question": "What is  a King's Scholar entitled to put after their name?", "id": "5ad21429d7d075001a428379", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "24", "answer_start": 136}], "question": "Typically how many students each year decide to become a Oppidan Scholar instead of a King's Scholar?", "id": "5ad21429d7d075001a42837a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "consistently performing with distinction in School and external examinations", "answer_start": 236}], "question": "How do King's Scholars get awarded with scholarships?", "id": "5ad21429d7d075001a42837b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Not all boys who pass the College election examination choose to become King's Scholars.
