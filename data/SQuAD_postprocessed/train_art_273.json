A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is assigning the marks a width of zero and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left sidebearing ( depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with ) . A mark handled this way will appear over whatever character precedes it , but will not adjust its position relative to the width or height of the base glyph ; it may be visually awkward and it may overlap some glyphs . Real stacking is impossible , but can be approximated in limited cases ( for example , Thai top - combining vowels and tone marks can just be at different heights to start with ) . Generally this approach is only effective in monospaced fonts , but may be used as a fallback rendering method when more complex methods fail .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What subset of Unicode is used by Windows?
