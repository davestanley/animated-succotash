This revision also saw significant changes in the definition of film speeds in order to accommodate then - recent changes in the American ASA PH2.5 - 1960 standard , so that film speeds of black - and - white negative film effectively would become doubled , that is , a film previously marked as \" 18 \u00b0 DIN \" would now be labeled as \" 21 DIN \" without emulsion changes .", "tags": "O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What took the place of the German DIN 4512 system?", "id": "57264597f1498d1400e8dace", "answers": [{"text": "ISO 6:1974, ISO 2240:1982, and ISO 5800:1979", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is sensitivity shown in the ISO systems?", "id": "57264597f1498d1400e8dacf", "answers": [{"text": "in linear and logarithmic form as \"ISO 100/21\u00b0\"", "answer_start": 184}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What standards did the DIN begin to use?", "id": "57264597f1498d1400e8dad0", "answers": [{"text": "ISO standards", "answer_start": 270}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When were the ISO standards first adopted?", "id": "57264597f1498d1400e8dad1", "answers": [{"text": "in the 1980s", "answer_start": 85}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When were the last ISO standards adopted?

A few camera designs also provide EI adjustment through a choice of lightness parameters for the interpretation of sensor data values into sRGB ; this variation allows different tradeoffs between the range of highlights that can be captured and the amount of noise introduced into the shadow areas of the photo .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What types of cameras have proven to be much more sensitive to light than film?", "id": "57265d27708984140094c3a1", "answers": [{"text": "Digital cameras", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What ISO equivalent speeds can digital cameras obtain?", "id": "57265d27708984140094c3a2", "answers": [{"text": "409,600", "answer_start": 110}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is responsible for these vast increases in speed?", "id": "57265d27708984140094c3a3", "answers": [{"text": "Faster processors, as well as advances in software noise reduction techniques", "answer_start": 196}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is one thing that limited speeds of older digital hardware?", "id": "57265d27708984140094c3a4", "answers": [{"text": "prohibitively time consuming to process", "answer_start": 451}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does the higher speed do for the images produced?", "id": "57265d27708984140094c3a5", "answers": [{"text": "a higher level of refinement", "answer_start": 402}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "sensitivity to light", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "How has film surpassed digital cameras?", "id": "5a67c170f038b7001ab0c44e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "409,600", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "What is the highest ISO speed a film camera can reach?", "id": "5a67c170f038b7001ab0c44f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "advances in software noise reduction techniques", "answer_start": 226}], "question": "What, besides a faster processor, prevents processing from happening when a photo is taken?", "id": "5a67c170f038b7001ab0c450", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "images that have a higher level of refinement", "answer_start": 385}], "question": "What could earlier generations of digital cameras store?", "id": "5a67c170f038b7001ab0c451", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "earlier", "answer_start": 496}], "question": "Which generation of cameras are capable of storing higher refined images?", "id": "5a67c170f038b7001ab0c452", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Digital cameras have far surpassed film in terms of sensitivity to light, with ISO equivalent speeds of up to 409,600, a number that is unfathomable in the realm of conventional film photography.

The factor \u221a2 indicates that there is half a stop of headroom to deal with specular reflections that would appear brighter than a 100 % reflecting white surface .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which ratios are employed to calculate noise-based speed?", "id": "57267360f1498d1400e8dffe", "answers": [{"text": "the 40:1 (\"excellent image quality\") and the 10:1 (\"acceptable image quality\") ratio", "answer_start": 140}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the noise-based speed?", "id": "57267360f1498d1400e8dfff", "answers": [{"text": "the exposure that will lead to a given signal-to-noise ratio on individual pixels", "answer_start": 36}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How are the two ratios found?", "id": "57267360f1498d1400e8e000", "answers": [{"text": "subjectively determined based on a resolution of 70 pixels per cm (178 DPI) when viewed at 25 cm (9.8 inch) distance", "answer_start": 249}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a definition of signal-to-noise ratio?", "id": "57267360f1498d1400e8e001", "answers": [{"text": "the standard deviation of a weighted average of the luminance and color of individual pixels", "answer_start": 407}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What factors influence the noise-based speed?", "id": "57267360f1498d1400e8e002", "answers": [{"text": "the properties of the sensor and somewhat affected by the noise in the electronic gain and AD converter", "answer_start": 547}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "40:1", "answer_start": 144}], "question": "Which ratio was subjectively determined?", "id": "5a67d93ff038b7001ab0c494", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The noise-based speed", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What are the individual pixels defined by?", "id": "5a67d93ff038b7001ab0c495", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "70 pixels per cm (178 DPI) when viewed at 25 cm (9.8 inch) distance", "answer_start": 298}], "question": "What is the signal-to-noise ration?", "id": "5a67d93ff038b7001ab0c496", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "70", "answer_start": 298}], "question": "How many pixels are in a 40:1 ratio image?", "id": "5a67d93ff038b7001ab0c497", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The signal-to-noise ratio", "answer_start": 367}], "question": "The weighted average of the luminance and the noise in the electronic gain is defined as what?", "id": "5a67d93ff038b7001ab0c498", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The noise-based speed is defined as the exposure that will lead to a given signal-to-noise ratio on individual pixels.
