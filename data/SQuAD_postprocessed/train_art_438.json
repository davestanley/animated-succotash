Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries.

Hunting is carried out with firearms , and aided by the use of hounds , with the illegal use of trap guns , trap cages and snare nets . With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years ( in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants ) , there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable . In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long ( 5 months - October to February inclusive ) . As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high . Added to that , there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game ( sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies ) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high . As a result , the populations of the five major mammalian game species ( red - rumped agouti , lowland paca , nine - banded armadillo , collared peccary , and red brocket deer ) are thought to be quite low ( although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013 ) . It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over - hunting . Various herons , ducks , doves , the green iguana , the gold tegu , the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached . There is also some poaching of ' fully protected species ' , including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys , southern tamanduas , Brazilian porcupines , yellow - footed tortoises , Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds , the scarlet ibis . Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting - ethics training . There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country ( with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit ) . The local wildlife management authority is under - staffed and under - funded , and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws , with hunting occurring both in and out of season , and even in wildlife sanctuaries . There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously , with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015 . It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments , and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O U-LOC O O O O

However , the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from \u201c extinct in the wild \u201d to \u201c vulnerable \u201d due to conservation efforts like captive breeding", "tags": "O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What type of creature is the American bison?", "id": "57351a8aacc1501500bac40b", "answers": [{"text": "a large bovid", "answer_start": 22}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the American bison inhabit much of prior to the 1800s?", "id": "57351a8aacc1501500bac40c", "answers": [{"text": "western North America", "answer_start": 60}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did market hunters leave the parts of the bison they didn't need to do?", "id": "57351a8aacc1501500bac40d", "answers": [{"text": "rot", "answer_start": 269}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the population of bison herds around prior to being eliminated by thousands of market hunters?", "id": "57351a8aacc1501500bac40e", "answers": [{"text": "several million", "answer_start": 366}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the current status of bison?", "id": "57351a8aacc1501500bac40f", "answers": [{"text": "near-threatened", "answer_start": 516}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did large herds of bison attract?", "id": "5736357e506b471400236596", "answers": [{"text": "market hunters", "answer_start": 184}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What part of North America did the bison live?", "id": "5736357e506b471400236597", "answers": [{"text": "western", "answer_start": 60}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why were the bison killed?", "id": "5736357e506b471400236598", "answers": [{"text": "for their hides", "answer_start": 227}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did hunter do with the rest of the bison?", "id": "5736357e506b471400236599", "answers": [{"text": "leaving the rest to rot", "answer_start": 249}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do bison still remain?", "id": "5736357e506b47140023659a", "answers": [{"text": "near-threatened", "answer_start": 516}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "western North America", "answer_start": 60}], "question": "What area did market hunters come from in the 1880's?", "id": "5aceace632bba1001ae4afed", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Thousands", "answer_start": 274}], "question": "How much did a bison hide cost in the 1800's?", "id": "5aceace632bba1001ae4afee", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "several million", "answer_start": 366}], "question": "What was the population of the US in 1880?", "id": "5aceace632bba1001ae4afef", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "prairies", "answer_start": 116}], "question": "What areas of the US were settled first in 1880?", "id": "5aceace632bba1001ae4aff0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rot", "answer_start": 269}], "question": "What were buildings prone to when built in a prarie area?", "id": "5aceace632bba1001ae4aff1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The American bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s, living on the prairies in large herds.
