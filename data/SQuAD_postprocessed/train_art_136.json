This was accommodated by removing _ ( underscore ) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters left , which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9 . This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit - paired keyboards , notably the Teletype Model 33 , which used the left - shifted layout corresponding to ASCII , not to traditional mechanical typewriters . Electric typewriters , notably the more recently introduced IBM Selectric ( 1961 ) , used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers\u2014\u200b\u200bfollowing the IBM PC ( 1981 ) , especially Model M ( 1984)\u2014\u200b\u200band thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did . The / ? pair also dates to the No . 2 , and the , < . > pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the No . 2 , did not shift , ( comma ) or . ( full stop ) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting ) . However , ASCII split the ; : pair ( dating to No . 2 ) , and rearranged mathematical symbols ( varied conventions , commonly - * = + ) to :* ; + -=.", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the official name of code 127?", "id": "570bfe83ec8fbc190045bc04", "answers": [{"text": "delete", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was code 127 labeled as for the Teletype?", "id": "570bfe83ec8fbc190045bc05", "answers": [{"text": "rubout", "answer_start": 66}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why did Teletype have the code for \"rubout\"?", "id": "570bfe83ec8fbc190045bc06", "answers": [{"text": "to make it an ignored character", "answer_start": 268}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "delete", "answer_start": 30}], "question": "What is the official name of an existing mark?", "id": "5a651510c2b11c001a425bf3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rubout", "answer_start": 66}], "question": "What was NUL named as for the Teletype?", "id": "5a651510c2b11c001a425bf4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "to make it an ignored character", "answer_start": 268}], "question": "Why did teletype have extra spaces for \"rubout\"?", "id": "5a651510c2b11c001a425bf5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "put into the empty space", "answer_start": 637}], "question": "What happened to replacements of control codes?", "id": "5a651510c2b11c001a425bf6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it", "answer_start": 384}], "question": "Why was standard code useful for paper tape?", "id": "5a651510c2b11c001a425bf7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Code 127 is officially named \"delete\" but the Teletype label was \"rubout\".
