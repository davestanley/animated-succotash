The period from the early 14th century up until \u2013 and sometimes including \u2013 the 16th century , is rather seen as characterised by other trends : demographic and economic decline followed by recovery , the end of western religious unity and the subsequent emergence of the nation state , and the expansion of European influence onto the rest of the world .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "When was the Kalmar Union formed?", "id": "5726a7a0f1498d1400e8e64a", "answers": [{"text": "1397", "answer_start": 110}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which Danish King was responsible for the Stockholm Bloodbath?", "id": "5726a7a0f1498d1400e8e64b", "answers": [{"text": "King Christian II", "answer_start": 232}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Sweden break away from the Kalmar Union?", "id": "5726a7a0f1498d1400e8e64c", "answers": [{"text": "1523", "answer_start": 433}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Denmark and Norway remained in the Kalmar Union until what year?", "id": "5726a7a0f1498d1400e8e64d", "answers": [{"text": "1814", "answer_start": 543}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did the Stockholm Bloodbath take place?", "id": "5726a7a0f1498d1400e8e64e", "answers": [{"text": "1520", "answer_start": 343}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1397", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "When wasn't the Kalmar Union formed?", "id": "5ad01e5177cf76001a686aae", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "King Christian II", "answer_start": 232}], "question": "Which Amish King was responsible for the Stockholm Bloodbath?", "id": "5ad01e5177cf76001a686aaf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1523", "answer_start": 433}], "question": "In what year did Finland break away from the Kalmar Union?", "id": "5ad01e5177cf76001a686ab0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1814", "answer_start": 543}], "question": "Denmark and Norway left in the Kalmar Union until what year?", "id": "5ad01e5177cf76001a686ab1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1520", "answer_start": 343}], "question": "In what year didn't the Stockholm Bloodbath take place?", "id": "5ad01e5177cf76001a686ab2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "After the failed union of Sweden and Norway of 1319\u20131365, the pan-Scandinavian Kalmar Union was instituted in 1397.

Hungary was the last bastion of the Latin Christian world in the East , and fought to keep its rule over a period of two centuries . After the tragic death of the young king Vladislaus I of Hungary during the Battle of Varna in 1444 against the Ottomans , the Kingdom was placed in the hands of count John Hunyadi , who became Hungary 's regent - governor ( 1446\u20131453 ) . Hunyadi was considered one of the most relevant military figures of the 15th century : Pope Pius II awarded him the title of Athleta Christi or Champion of Christ for being the only hope of resisting the Ottomans from advancing to Central and Western Europe .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O U-LOC O O U-LOC O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O U-LOC O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-MISC O O U-LOC O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O U-LOC O B-LOC L-LOC O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which Franciscan monk motivated the peasants to fight against Muslims at the Siege of Belgrade?", "id": "57277421708984140094ddf7", "answers": [{"text": "Saint John of Capistrano", "answer_start": 238}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year was the Siege of Belgrade fought?", "id": "57277421708984140094ddf8", "answers": [{"text": "1456", "answer_start": 50}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did the Hungarian nobility elect as King of Hungary?", "id": "57277421708984140094ddf9", "answers": [{"text": "Matthias", "answer_start": 568}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country did Saint Francis of Capistrano come from?", "id": "57277421708984140094ddfa", "answers": [{"text": "Italy", "answer_start": 278}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When John Hunyadi died, which province was left in chaos?", "id": "57277421708984140094ddfb", "answers": [{"text": "Pannonia", "answer_start": 467}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Saint John of Capistrano", "answer_start": 238}], "question": "Which Franciscan monk motivated the peasants to fight for Muslims at the Siege of Belgrade?", "id": "5ad02f5777cf76001a686d7a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1456", "answer_start": 50}], "question": "In what year wasn't the Siege of Belgrade fought?", "id": "5ad02f5777cf76001a686d7b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Matthias", "answer_start": 568}], "question": "Who didn't the Hungarian nobility elect as King of Hungary?", "id": "5ad02f5777cf76001a686d7c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Italy", "answer_start": 278}], "question": "Which country didn't Saint Francis of Capistrano come from?", "id": "5ad02f5777cf76001a686d7d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Pannonia", "answer_start": 467}], "question": "When John Hunyadi died, which province was left in peace?", "id": "5ad02f5777cf76001a686d7e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Hunyadi succeeded during the Siege of Belgrade in 1456 against the Ottomans, the biggest victory against that empire in decades.
