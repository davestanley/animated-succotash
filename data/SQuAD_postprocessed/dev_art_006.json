The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred.

Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century , where their efficiency , higher speed appropriate to generator service , and smooth rotation were advantages . Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines . In the United States 90 % of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources . Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the usual source of heat for boiling water in the steam engine?", "id": "571144d1a58dae1900cd6d6e", "answers": [{"text": "burning combustible materials", "answer_start": 120}, {"text": "burning combustible materials", "answer_start": 120}, {"text": "burning combustible materials", "answer_start": 120}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Aside from firebox, what is another name for the space in which combustible material is burned in the engine?", "id": "571144d1a58dae1900cd6d6f", "answers": [{"text": "combustion chamber", "answer_start": 220}, {"text": "combustion chamber", "answer_start": 220}, {"text": "combustion chamber", "answer_start": 220}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with nuclear, geothermal and internal combustion engine waste heat, what sort of energy might supply the heat for a steam engine?", "id": "571144d1a58dae1900cd6d70", "answers": [{"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}, {"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}, {"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of heating element is often used in toy steam engines?", "id": "571144d1a58dae1900cd6d71", "answers": [{"text": "electric", "answer_start": 475}, {"text": "electric heating element", "answer_start": 475}, {"text": "electric", "answer_start": 475}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "burning combustible materials", "answer_start": 120}], "question": "What is the usual source of heat for boiling water in the industrial process?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff30d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "What, aside from firebox, is another name for the space in which combustible material is burned in the electric heating element?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff30e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "electric", "answer_start": 475}], "question": "What type of heating element is often used in toy chamber engines?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff30f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "What sort of energy, along with nuclear, geothermal, and internal combustion waste heat, might supply the heat for a firebox?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff310", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "electric", "answer_start": 475}], "question": "What type of heating element is often used in closed space engines?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff311", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (called variously combustion chamber, firebox).
