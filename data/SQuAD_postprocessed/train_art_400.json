Tommaso di Aquino circa il Peccato originale , relativamente alla Beatissima Vergine Maria [ A critical examination of the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas , the Angelic Doctor , regarding original sin with respect to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary ] , in which Aquinas is interpreted not as treating the question of the Immaculate Conception later formulated in the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus but rather the sanctification of the fetus within Mary 's womb . Spada furnished an interpretation whereby Pius IX was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the Aquinas ' teaching . Pope Pius IX would later appoint Spada Master of the Sacred Palace in 1867 .", "tags": "O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O B-PER L-PER O O B-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER L-PER O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O U-PER O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who began to query the position of the conception of Mary following the 11th century ?", "id": "5730ef4105b4da19006bcc60", "answers": [{"text": "St Bernard of Clairvaux", "answer_start": 22}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did the query starter lay blame upon for the festivals that surrounded Mary's inception ?", "id": "5730ef4205b4da19006bcc61", "answers": [{"text": "St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See.", "answer_start": 246}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the query starter believe to be the ultimate difficulty in accepting  the a virgin conception of Mary ?", "id": "5730ef4205b4da19006bcc62", "answers": [{"text": "How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (libido)?", "answer_start": 762}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the query starter believe had been done by Mary's direct  maternal line that contradict the conception theory of immaculate for Mary ?", "id": "5730ef4205b4da19006bcc63", "answers": [{"text": "conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation", "answer_start": 672}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Did the query starter believe that the festival for Mary's conception had authorization to be held ?", "id": "5730ef4205b4da19006bcc64", "answers": [{"text": "instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See", "answer_start": 314}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "St Bernard of Clairvaux", "answer_start": 22}], "question": "Who raised the question of the Immaculate Conception in the 1200s?", "id": "5a273563c93d92001a400425", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin", "answer_start": 133}], "question": "What was already being celebrated in some churches of the East?", "id": "5a273563c93d92001a400426", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "church of Lyon", "answer_start": 295}], "question": "Who instituted a feast of the conception of the Blessed Virgin with the permission of the Holy See?", "id": "5a273563c93d92001a400427", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mary", "answer_start": 469}], "question": "Whose conception does St. Bernard say was sinless?", "id": "5a273563c93d92001a400428", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Pope Pius IX", "answer_start": 614}], "question": "What Pope's definition of conception agreed with St. Bernard's?", "id": "5a273563c93d92001a400429", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "It seems to have been St Bernard of Clairvaux who, in the 12th century, explicitly raised the question of the Immaculate Conception.
