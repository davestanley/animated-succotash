This explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper . At the macroscopic scale , introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice , such as grain boundaries , hinders flow of the material under applied stress , thereby increasing its hardness . For this reason , copper is usually supplied in a fine - grained polycrystalline form , which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the concentration of copper in the earths crust.", "id": "570962e2ed30961900e8404e", "answers": [{"text": "50 parts per million", "answer_start": 103}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How large was the biggest find of copper?", "id": "570962e2ed30961900e8404f", "answers": [{"text": "420 tonnes", "answer_start": 378}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year was the largest find of copper discovered?", "id": "570962e2ed30961900e84050", "answers": [{"text": "1857", "answer_start": 406}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was the largest mass of copper found?", "id": "570962e2ed30961900e84051", "answers": [{"text": "Michigan, US", "answer_start": 440}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How big is the largest copper crystal that has been found?", "id": "570962e2ed30961900e84052", "answers": [{"text": "4.4\u00d73.2\u00d73.2 cm", "answer_start": 538}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "50 parts per million", "answer_start": 103}], "question": "What is the concentration of copper in the earths atmosphere?", "id": "5a8353c7e60761001a2eb58d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "420 tonnes", "answer_start": 378}], "question": "How large was the smallest find of copper?", "id": "5a8353c7e60761001a2eb58e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1857", "answer_start": 406}], "question": "What year was the smallest find of copper discovered?", "id": "5a8353c7e60761001a2eb58f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Michigan, US", "answer_start": 440}], "question": "Where was the smallest mass of copper found?", "id": "5a8353c7e60761001a2eb590", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "4.4\u00d73.2\u00d73.2 cm", "answer_start": 538}], "question": "How big is the largest alien crystal that has been found?", "id": "5a8353c7e60761001a2eb591", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Copper is synthesized in massive stars and is present in the Earth's crust at a concentration of about 50 parts per million (ppm), where it occurs as native copper or in minerals such as the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite, the copper carbonates azurite and malachite, and the copper(I) oxide mineral cuprite.

Pure copper is orange - red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air . The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half - empty 4s atomic shells \u2013 the energy difference between these shells is such that it corresponds to orange light . The same mechanism accounts for the yellow color of gold and caesium .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has copper been used for since ancient times?", "id": "570990baed30961900e84338", "answers": [{"text": "architectural material", "answer_start": 93}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In recent times what is one interior use copper been expanded to include?", "id": "570990baed30961900e84339", "answers": [{"text": "antimicrobial indoor products", "answer_start": 424}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an important benefit to using copper as an architectural material?", "id": "570990baed30961900e8433a", "answers": [{"text": "low thermal movement", "answer_start": 605}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How long has copper been used in building construction?", "id": "570990baed30961900e8433b", "answers": [{"text": "hundreds or thousands of years", "answer_start": 225}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the benefit to using copper for things such as counter tops and hand rails?", "id": "570990baed30961900e8433c", "answers": [{"text": "antimicrobial", "answer_start": 424}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "architectural material", "answer_start": 93}], "question": "What has copper been avoided as since ancient times?", "id": "5a836e5fe60761001a2eb6cd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antimicrobial indoor products", "answer_start": 424}], "question": "What is one interior use copper has been forbidden to include?", "id": "5a836e5fe60761001a2eb6ce", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "low thermal movement", "answer_start": 605}], "question": "What is an important danger to using copper as an architectural material?", "id": "5a836e5fe60761001a2eb6cf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "hundreds or thousands of years", "answer_start": 225}], "question": "How long has copper been banned in building construction?", "id": "5a836e5fe60761001a2eb6d0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antimicrobial", "answer_start": 424}], "question": "What is the danger to using copper for things such as counter tops and hand rails?", "id": "5a836e5fe60761001a2eb6d1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Copper has been used since ancient times as a durable, corrosion resistant, and weatherproof architectural material.
