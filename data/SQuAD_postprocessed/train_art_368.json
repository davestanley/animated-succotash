This included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules , distinguished from his Gymnospermae , or flowering plants with achenial or schizo - carpic fruits , the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked . The term and its antonym were maintained by Carl Linnaeus with the same sense , but with restricted application , in the names of the orders of his class Didynamia . Its use with any approach to its modern scope became possible only after 1827 , when Robert Brown established the existence of truly naked ovules in the Cycadeae and Coniferae , and applied to them the name Gymnosperms.[citation needed ] From that time onward , as long as these Gymnosperms were , as was usual , reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants , the term Angiosperm was used antithetically by botanical writers , with varying scope , as a group - name for other dicotyledonous plants .", "tags": "O O O O U-MISC O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O U-LOC O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In taxonomies, what type of group are flowering plants treated?", "id": "572f44e8b2c2fd1400567fb3", "answers": [{"text": "coherent", "answer_start": 58}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does anthophyta mean?", "id": "572f44e8b2c2fd1400567fb4", "answers": [{"text": "flowering plants", "answer_start": 163}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do the Wettstein and Engler systems use at the assigned rank of subdivision?", "id": "572f44e8b2c2fd1400567fb5", "answers": [{"text": "Angiospermae", "answer_start": 295}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How does the APG system of 1998, with its 2003 and 2009 revisions, treat flowering plants?", "id": "572f44e8b2c2fd1400567fb6", "answers": [{"text": "a clade called angiosperms", "answer_start": 907}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What formal subclass classification were flowering plants given in 2009?", "id": "572f44e8b2c2fd1400567fb7", "answers": [{"text": "Magnoliidae", "answer_start": 1090}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "any rank", "answer_start": 229}], "question": "What are coherent groups not linked to?", "id": "5a3aed493ff257001ab84329", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Angiospermae", "answer_start": 295}], "question": "What do Anthophyta and Magnoliophytina use as the assigned rank of subdivision?", "id": "5a3aed493ff257001ab8432a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name", "answer_start": 904}], "question": "How does the APG system of 1996 treat flowering plants?", "id": "5a3aed493ff257001ab8432b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a formal classification", "answer_start": 976}], "question": "What taxonomy was published alongside the 2003 revision?", "id": "5a3aed493ff257001ab8432c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "(\"flowering plants\")", "answer_start": 161}], "question": "What does Magnoliophytina mean?", "id": "5a3aed493ff257001ab8432d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In most taxonomies, the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group.
