In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems.

In the days of the Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread.", "allenNER": {"words": "Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost - free period , plenty of sunshine , and a moderate rainfall , usually from 600 to 1,200 mm ( 24 to 47 in ) . Soils usually need to be fairly heavy , although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional . In general , these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres , but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation . Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn . Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests . Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June . The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton - growing region in the world . While dryland ( non - irrigated ) cotton is successfully grown in this region , consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer . Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant , this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions . As water resources get tighter around the world , economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict , as well as potential environmental problems . For example , improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan , where cotton is a major export .

Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose . In the UK , linters are referred to as \" cotton wool \" . This can also be a refined product ( absorbent cotton in U.S. usage ) which has medical , cosmetic and many other practical uses . The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen 's Hospital ( later the General Hospital ) in Birmingham , England .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O U-LOC O U-LOC O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is a fine, tightly twisted type of cotton fabric?", "id": "572763db708984140094dce3", "answers": [{"text": "Cotton lisle", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is lisle considered to be as a fabric?", "id": "572763db708984140094dce4", "answers": [{"text": "strong and durable", "answer_start": 86}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does extra twisting of lisle thread produce?", "id": "572763db708984140094dce5", "answers": [{"text": "single thread", "answer_start": 236}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was the lisle thread originally made?", "id": "572763db708984140094dce6", "answers": [{"text": "Lisle, France", "answer_start": 515}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is color perceived to be for lisle in comparison to softer yarns?

Once both diploid genomes are assembled , then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties . This strategy is out of necessity ; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes , the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co - assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively . Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What companies finished much of the sequencing of the D genome?", "id": "57277399708984140094dde3", "answers": [{"text": "Monsanto and Illumina", "answer_start": 359}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the sequencing of D genome of G.  raimondii mostly completed?", "id": "57277399708984140094dde4", "answers": [{"text": "2010", "answer_start": 338}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Monsanto and Illumina say they would do with the research?", "id": "57277399708984140094dde5", "answers": [{"text": "donate", "answer_start": 500}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the seeming result of donating genetic cotton sequencing to the public?", "id": "57277399708984140094dde6", "answers": [{"text": "public relations", "answer_start": 543}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What plants are the goal of sequencing wild forms of cotton?", "id": "57277399708984140094dde7", "answers": [{"text": "cultivated varieties", "answer_start": 754}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Monsanto and Illumina", "answer_start": 359}], "question": "What companies finished much of the sequencing of the BAC genome?", "id": "5a81a9d631013a001a334d3b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2010", "answer_start": 338}], "question": "When was the sequencing of D genome of AD, raimondii mostly completed?", "id": "5a81a9d631013a001a334d3c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "donate", "answer_start": 500}], "question": "What did Monsanto and Illumina say they would do with the D genome of G?", "id": "5a81a9d631013a001a334d3d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "public relations", "answer_start": 543}], "question": "What is the seeming result of donating genetic cotton sequencing to the AD genomes?", "id": "5a81a9d631013a001a334d3e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cultivated varieties", "answer_start": 754}], "question": "What plants are the goal of sequencing wild forms of BAC?", "id": "5a81a9d631013a001a334d3f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources.
