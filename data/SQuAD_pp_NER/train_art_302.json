In a bid to gain a majority , a second election was soon called for October 1974 in which Labour , still with Harold Wilson as leader , won a majority of three , gaining just 18 seats taking its total to 319 .", "tags": "O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O U-PER O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Fear of advances by the nationalist parties", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What led to the promotion of a report from the Scottish Office?", "id": "5ad13aca645df0001a2d12d4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "by-election losses", "answer_start": 238}], "question": "What left Callaghan leading a majority government?", "id": "5ad13aca645df0001a2d12d5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "to govern", "answer_start": 403}], "question": "Why did Callaghan trade with the larger parties?", "id": "5ad13aca645df0001a2d12d6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Lib-Lab Pact", "answer_start": 494}], "question": "What arrangement lasted longer than one year?", "id": "5ad13aca645df0001a2d12d7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Deals", "answer_start": 530}], "question": "What shortened the life of the government?", "id": "5ad13aca645df0001a2d12d8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Fear of advances by the nationalist parties, particularly in Scotland, led to the suppression of a report from Scottish Office economist Gavin McCrone that suggested that an independent Scotland would be 'chronically in surplus'.

The red rose , a symbol of social democracy , was adopted as the party symbol in 1986 as part of a rebranding exercise and is now incorporated into the party logo .", "tags": "U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"plausible_answers": [{"text": "National Executive Committee", "answer_start": 76}], "question": "What are the party's decision making bodies on a local level?", "id": "5ad16586645df0001a2d1996", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Parliamentary leadership", "answer_start": 193}], "question": "What has the first say on policy?", "id": "5ad16586645df0001a2d1997", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2008", "answer_start": 251}], "question": "When was the first time trade unions had the right to submit motions?", "id": "5ad16586645df0001a2d1998", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Labour Party conferences", "answer_start": 464}], "question": "What includes less keynote addresses now?", "id": "5ad16586645df0001a2d1999", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "National Policy Forum", "answer_start": 635}], "question": "Where does discussion of policy never take place?", "id": "5ad16586645df0001a2d199a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The party's decision-making bodies on a national level formally include the National Executive Committee (NEC), Labour Party Conference and National Policy Forum (NPF)\u2014although in practice the Parliamentary leadership has the final say on policy.
