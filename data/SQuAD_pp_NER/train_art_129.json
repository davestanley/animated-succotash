However , the Church of Rome still regarded 25 March as the equinox ( until 342 ) and used a different cycle to compute the day of the moon . In the Alexandrian system , since the 14th day of the Easter moon could fall at earliest on 21 March its first day could fall no earlier than 8 March and no later than 5 April . This meant that Easter varied between 22 March and 25 April . In Rome , Easter was not allowed to fall later than 21 April , that being the day of the Parilia or birthday of Rome and a pagan festival . The first day of the Easter moon could fall no earlier than 5 March and no later than 2 April .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who was the architect of the Gregorian calendar?", "id": "570b2c16ec8fbc190045b8ae", "answers": [{"text": "Christopher Clavius", "answer_start": 50}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the architects of the calendar notice about the astronomical tables?", "id": "570b2c16ec8fbc190045b8af", "answers": [{"text": "discrepancies", "answer_start": 278}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Whose solution to the discrepancies of the tables would have been agreeable to astronomers?", "id": "570b2c16ec8fbc190045b8b0", "answers": [{"text": "Petrus Pitatus", "answer_start": 370}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Pitatus offer his solution to the leap year problem?", "id": "570b2c16ec8fbc190045b8b1", "answers": [{"text": "1560", "answer_start": 398}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the theory about leap year called?", "id": "570b2c16ec8fbc190045b8b2", "answers": [{"text": "Gregorian leap year rule", "answer_start": 297}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ancient tables", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What provided the sons mean latitude?", "id": "5a36fbd195360f001af1b39d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Christopher Clavius", "answer_start": 50}], "question": "Who noticed that the tables agreed on the time the sun passed the vernal equinox?", "id": "5a36fbd195360f001af1b39e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Petrus Pitatus", "answer_start": 370}], "question": "Who suggested ninety-seven leap years in 400 years during the fifteenth century", "id": "5a36fbd195360f001af1b39f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Pitatus of Verona", "answer_start": 377}], "question": "Who solution to discrepancies in the tables was not agreeable to astronomers?", "id": "5a36fbd195360f001af1b3a0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gregorian calendar,", "answer_start": 92}], "question": "What calendar did Pitatus create?", "id": "5a36fbd195360f001af1b3a1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Ancient tables provided the sun's mean longitude.
