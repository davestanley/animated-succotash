This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems . Within the EU itself , the Court of Justice 's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law , then EU law has primacy . In the first major case in 1964 , Costa v ENEL , a Milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel , as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations . He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome , and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267 . The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , Costa had no claim . By contrast , the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim , not Mr Costa . However , in principle , Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law , and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision . The Court of Justice , repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos , said member states \" albeit within limited spheres , have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \" . EU law would not \" be overridden by domestic legal provisions , however framed ... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question . \" This meant any \" subsequent unilateral act \" of the member state inapplicable .

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\".

The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised.

This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary . Thus , the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies ( where restrictions must be justified ) , and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory , although it is not entirely clear why .", "tags": "O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O U-ORG O O U-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O U-LOC O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O U-LOC O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}]}, "version": ["v2.0"]}
