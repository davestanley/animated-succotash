Genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species suggests that the potato has a single origin in the area of southern Peru , from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex . Over 99 % of all modern cultivated potatoes worldwide are descendants of a subspecies indigenous to south - central Chile , Solanum tuberosum ssp . tuberosum , where it was cultivated as long as 10,000 years ago .
