The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade . In June 1917 , he released The Finished Mystery as a seventh volume of Russell 's Studies in the Scriptures series . The book , published as the posthumous work of Russell , was a compilation of his commentaries on the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation , plus numerous additions by Bible Students Clayton Woodworth and George Fisher . It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War . As a result , Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the Espionage Act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence ; charges against the directors were dropped in 1920 .", "tags": "O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O B-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O U-MISC O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did Rutherford institute the appointment of in each congregation in 1919?", "id": "57323ec2b9d445190005e90d", "answers": [{"text": "a director", "answer_start": 116}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What were all members instructed to report weekly to the Brooklyn headquarters?", "id": "57323ec2b9d445190005e90e", "answers": [{"text": "preaching activity", "answer_start": 217}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where as an international convention held in September of 1922?", "id": "57323ec2b9d445190005e90f", "answers": [{"text": "Cedar Point, Ohio", "answer_start": 305}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was a new emphasis made on at the international convention?", "id": "57323ec2b9d445190005e910", "answers": [{"text": "house-to-house preaching", "answer_start": 370}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How long was Rutherford's tenure as president of the Society?", "id": "57323ec2b9d445190005e911", "answers": [{"text": "twenty-five years", "answer_start": 493}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "September", "answer_start": 327}], "question": "In what month in 1920 did Rutherford claim that some Jewish patriarchs would be resurrected in 1925?", "id": "5ad3b5cd604f3c001a3fedd9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "tens of thousands", "answer_start": 728}], "question": "How many people attended the Cedar Point, Ohio, convention of the Watch Tower Society?", "id": "5ad3b5cd604f3c001a3feddb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1922", "answer_start": 337}], "question": "In what year did the first Bible Student organizations split from the Watch Tower Society?", "id": "5ad3b5cd604f3c001a3feddc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society.
