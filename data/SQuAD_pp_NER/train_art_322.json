However , neoclassical architecture only became popular in Malta following the establishment of British rule in the early 19th century . In 1814 , a neoclassical portico decorated with the British coat of arms was added to the Main Guard building so as to serve as a symbol of British Malta . Other 19th century neoclassical buildings include RNH Bighi ( 1832 ) , St Paul 's Pro - Cathedral ( 1844 ) , the Rotunda of Mosta ( 1860 ) and the now destroyed Royal Opera House ( 1866 ) .", "tags": "U-MISC O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O O O O O U-LOC O U-LOC O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what are of architecture is neoclassical currently classed?", "id": "572999673f37b319004784df", "answers": [{"text": "New Classical Architecture", "answer_start": 129}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the term for sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture?", "id": "572999673f37b319004784e0", "answers": [{"text": "Traditional Architecture", "answer_start": 418}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the award for major contributions to traditional of classical architecture in 21st century?", "id": "572999673f37b319004784e1", "answers": [{"text": "The Driehaus Architecture Prize", "answer_start": 475}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is another name for New Classical Architecture?", "id": "572999673f37b319004784e2", "answers": [{"text": "Neo-Historicism/Revivalism, Traditionalism", "answer_start": 193}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "New Classical Architecture.", "answer_start": 129}], "question": "What was neoclassicism classified under starting in the twentieth century?", "id": "5a2c4e23bfd06b001a5aeb0d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Neo-Historicism/Revivalism", "answer_start": 193}], "question": "What is new classical architecture also referred to as", "id": "5a2c4e23bfd06b001a5aeb0e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Traditional Architecture", "answer_start": 418}], "question": "What refers to architecture that uses a wide variety of materials and craftsmanship from different regions?", "id": "5a2c4e23bfd06b001a5aeb0f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Driehaus Architecture Prize", "answer_start": 475}], "question": "What is awarded to architects who contribute to 21st-century classical architecture?", "id": "5a2c4e23bfd06b001a5aeb10", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of New Classical Architecture.
