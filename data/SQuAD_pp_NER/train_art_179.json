Women 's evening dress included obligatory trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair ( or both ) . The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed . After World War I , when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground , she requested a lady - in - waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king 's reaction . King George V was horrified , so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low . Following their accession in 1936 , King George VI and his consort , Queen Elizabeth , allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise . Today , there is no official dress code . Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits ; a minority wear morning coats , and in the evening , depending on the formality of the occasion , black tie or white tie .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Under whose reign did court presentations of young aristocratic ladies take place?", "id": "5725ee8a38643c19005acebb", "answers": [{"text": "Edward VII", "answer_start": 107}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the name for the ceremony where debutantes had their first introduction into society?", "id": "5725ee8a38643c19005acebc", "answers": [{"text": "coming out", "answer_start": 194}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Debutantes wore the feather of which bird in their hair?", "id": "5725ee8a38643c19005acebd", "answers": [{"text": "ostrich feathers", "answer_start": 301}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "After WWII \"coming out\" ceremonies were replaces with what event?", "id": "5725ee8a38643c19005acebe", "answers": [{"text": "less formal afternoon receptions", "answer_start": 633}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under whose reign were young debutantes presented to society at Court?", "id": "57261c35271a42140099d485", "answers": [{"text": "Edward VII", "answer_start": 107}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What types of feathers did debutantes wear in their hair?", "id": "57261c35271a42140099d486", "answers": [{"text": "ostrich feathers", "answer_start": 301}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the occasion where debutantes were presented to society called?", "id": "57261c35271a42140099d487", "answers": [{"text": "\"coming out\"", "answer_start": 193}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "After WWII what was the coming out ceremony replaced with?", "id": "57261c35271a42140099d488", "answers": [{"text": "less formal afternoon receptions", "answer_start": 633}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Edward VII", "answer_start": 107}], "question": "Whose reign did not include court presentations of young aristocratic ladies?", "id": "5a7a486617ab25001a8a045e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "coming out", "answer_start": 194}], "question": "What was the name for the sacrifice where debutantes had their last introduction into society?", "id": "5a7a486617ab25001a8a045f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ostrich feathers", "answer_start": 301}], "question": "What bird's feathers did debutantes wear in their shirt?", "id": "5a7a486617ab25001a8a0460", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "coming out", "answer_start": 194}], "question": "What was the occasion where debutantes were exiled from society called?", "id": "5a7a486617ab25001a8a0461", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "less formal afternoon receptions", "answer_start": 633}], "question": "What was the coming out ceremony replaced with during WWII?", "id": "5a7a486617ab25001a8a0462", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of Edward VII.
