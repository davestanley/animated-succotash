Because of his association with D - Dot , West was n't able to release a solo album , so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go - Getters , a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him , GLC , Timmy G , Really Doe , and Arrowstar . His group was managed by John \" Monopoly \" Johnson , Don Crowley , and Happy Lewis under the management firm Hustle Period . After attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances , The Go - Getters released their first and only studio album World Record Holders in 1999 . The album featured other Chicago - based rappers such as Rhymefest , Mikkey Halsted , Miss Criss , and Shayla G. Meanwhile , the production was handled by West , Arrowstar , Boogz , and Brian \" All Day \" Miller .", "tags": "B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O U-LOC O O U-PER O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O U-MISC O U-PER O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-PER O O O U-LOC O O O O O O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O U-PER O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-ORG O U-PER O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O U-PER O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Kanye produced the third song from the second album of what artist?", "id": "56cf6141aab44d1400b89195", "answers": [{"text": "Foxy Brown", "answer_start": 123}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What rappers were featured in the songs that Kanye produced for Tell 'Em Why U Madd?", "id": "56cf6141aab44d1400b89198", "answers": [{"text": "Ma$e, Raekwon, and Eminem.", "answer_start": 1117}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which U.S. Billboard 200 chart topper did Kanye West produce a song for?", "id": "56d100b517492d1400aab708", "answers": [{"text": "Foxy Brown", "answer_start": 123}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the name of the CD produced by Kanye that was by a made-up character?", "id": "56d100b517492d1400aab70a", "answers": [{"text": "Tell 'Em Why U Madd", "answer_start": 845}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "West spent much of the late-1990s producing records for a number of well-known artists and music groups.

Drawing inspiration from artists such as Gary Numan , TJ Swan and Boy George , and maintaining a \" minimal but functional \" approach towards the album 's studio production , West explored the electronic feel produced by Auto - Tune and utilized the sounds created by the 808 , manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted , electronic sound ; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks . The album 's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums , lengthy strings , droning synthesizers , and somber piano , and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post - punk and new wave groups , with West himself later confessing an affinity with British post - punk group Joy Division .
