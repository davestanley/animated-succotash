Aside from upholding international copyright treaty obligations to provide general limitations and exceptions , nations have enacted compulsory licensing laws applying specifically to digital works and uses . For example , in the U.S. , the DMCA , an implementation of the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty , considers digital transmissions of audio recordings to be licensed as long as a designated copyright collective 's royalty and reporting requirements are met . The DMCA also provides safe harbor for digital service providers whose users are suspected of copyright infringement , thus reducing the likelihood that the providers themselves will be considered directly infringing .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O U-MISC O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What do some copyright owners do by reducing the scope of infringement?", "id": "5726db83708984140094d3c5", "answers": [{"text": "employing relatively permissive, \"open\" licensing", "answer_start": 89}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What must a user do under a prepared license?", "id": "5726db83708984140094d3c6", "answers": [{"text": "adhere to certain conditions", "answer_start": 405}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Besides lessening the burden on the courts, what is the effect of this license?", "id": "5726db83708984140094d3c7", "answers": [{"text": "reducing infringement", "answer_start": 458}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a free software license?", "id": "5726db83708984140094d3c8", "answers": [{"text": "GNU General Public License", "answer_start": 661}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What works do Creative Commons licenses generally apply to?", "id": "5726db83708984140094d3c9", "answers": [{"text": "visual and literary works", "answer_start": 765}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "employing relatively permissive, \"open\" licensing strategies", "answer_start": 89}], "question": "What do some copyright owners do by increasing the scope of infringement?", "id": "5ad0172677cf76001a686980", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "adhere to certain conditions", "answer_start": 405}], "question": "What mustn't a user do under a prepared license?", "id": "5ad0172677cf76001a686981", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "reducing infringement", "answer_start": 458}], "question": "Besides heightening the burden on the courts, what is the effect of this license?", "id": "5ad0172677cf76001a686982", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "GNU General Public License", "answer_start": 661}], "question": "What is an example of a paid software license?", "id": "5ad0172677cf76001a686983", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "visual and literary works.", "answer_start": 765}], "question": "What works do Creative Commons licenses generally not apply to?", "id": "5ad0172677cf76001a686984", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Some copyright owners voluntarily reduce the scope of what is considered infringement by employing relatively permissive, \"open\" licensing strategies: rather than privately negotiating license terms with individual users who must first seek out the copyright owner and ask for permission, the copyright owner publishes and distributes the work with a prepared license that anyone can use, as long as they adhere to certain conditions.
