A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled : for example , if people can have more than one phone number , it will allow this information to be captured . Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain ; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organisation , like \" can a customer also be a supplier ? \" , or \" if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging , are those the same product or different products ? \" , or \" if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt , is that one flight or two ( or maybe even three ) ? \" . The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities ( customers , products , flights , flight segments ) and their relationships and attributes .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what form is the output of a logical database design?", "id": "572fabfe947a6a140053cb4e", "answers": [{"text": "schema", "answer_start": 303}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which data model is displayed as a specific model that uses DBMS?", "id": "572fabfe947a6a140053cb4f", "answers": [{"text": "logical", "answer_start": 423}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "A conceptual data model in separate from the choice of what?", "id": "572fabfe947a6a140053cb50", "answers": [{"text": "database technology", "answer_start": 398}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "schema", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "What form is the input of a logical database design?", "id": "5a8c8a11fd22b3001a8d8a5c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "logical", "answer_start": 257}], "question": "Which data model is displayed as a nonspecific model that uses DBMS?", "id": "5a8c8a11fd22b3001a8d8a5d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the choice of database technology", "answer_start": 384}], "question": "What is the conceptual data model dependent on?", "id": "5a8c8a11fd22b3001a8d8a5e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "data model and database model", "answer_start": 541}], "question": "What terms are no longer used interchangeably?", "id": "5a8c8a11fd22b3001a8d8a5f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into a schema that implements the relevant data structures within the database.

Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database . Using passwords , users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called \" subschemas \" . For example , an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee , but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data , while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data . If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database , as well as interrogate it , this capability allows for managing personal databases .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is a unit of work called in a database?", "id": "572fb513947a6a140053cbc4", "answers": [{"text": "transaction", "answer_start": 136}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How can database transactions ensure accuracy after a crash?", "id": "572fb513947a6a140053cbc5", "answers": [{"text": "fault tolerance", "answer_start": 61}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Are transactions limited?", "id": "572fb513947a6a140053cbc6", "answers": [{"text": "Each transaction has well defined boundaries", "answer_start": 357}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "transaction", "answer_start": 136}], "question": "What is a unit of play called in a database?", "id": "5a8c90e0fd22b3001a8d8b2e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "fault tolerance", "answer_start": 61}], "question": "How can database transactions lower accuracy after a crash?", "id": "5a8c90e0fd22b3001a8d8b2f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Each transaction", "answer_start": 357}], "question": "What has poorly defined boundaries in a database?", "id": "5a8c90e0fd22b3001a8d8b30", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "data integrity", "answer_start": 81}], "question": "What has no ability to recover from a crash?", "id": "5a8c90e0fd22b3001a8d8b31", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "database transaction", "answer_start": 127}], "question": "What always encapsulates only one transaction?", "id": "5a8c90e0fd22b3001a8d8b32", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Database transactions can be used to introduce some level of fault tolerance and data integrity after recovery from a crash.
