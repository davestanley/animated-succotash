Scandinavians ( Varangians ) and Finnic peoples were involved in the early formation of the Rus ' state but were completely Slavicized after a century . Some Finno - Ugric tribes in the north were also absorbed into the expanding Rus population . At the time of the Magyar migration , the present - day Hungary was inhabited by Slavs , numbering about 200,000 , and by Romano - Dacians who were either assimilated or enslaved by the Magyars . In the 11th and 12th centuries , constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes , such as the Kipchaks and the Pechenegs , caused a massive migration of East Slavic populations to the safer , heavily forested regions of the north . In the Middle Ages , groups of Saxon ore miners settled in medieval Bosnia , Serbia and Bulgaria where they were Slavicized .", "tags": "O O B-LOC L-LOC O B-MISC L-MISC O B-MISC L-MISC O O U-PER O O O O O U-MISC O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O U-MISC O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O U-MISC O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-LOC O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O U-LOC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O U-PER O U-MISC O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O U-MISC O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-LOC O U-LOC O U-LOC O O O U-MISC O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who settled in parts of England?", "id": "56f761b0a6d7ea1400e17232", "answers": [{"text": "Polabian Slavs (Wends)", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where did Polabian Slavs (Wends) settle?", "id": "56f761b0a6d7ea1400e17233", "answers": [{"text": "parts of England (Danelaw)", "answer_start": 34}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Polabian-Pomeranian Slavs are also known to have even settled where?", "id": "56f761b0a6d7ea1400e17234", "answers": [{"text": "Norse age Iceland", "answer_start": 156}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What refers to the Slavic mercenaries and slaves in the medieval Arab world in North Africa, Sicily and Al-Andalus?", "id": "56f761b0a6d7ea1400e17235", "answers": [{"text": "Saqaliba", "answer_start": 175}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Saqaliba served as what?", "id": "56f761b0a6d7ea1400e17236", "answers": [{"text": "caliph's guards", "answer_start": 314}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Danelaw", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "What is another name for Iceland?", "id": "5ad504705b96ef001a10a9c0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Saqaliba", "answer_start": 175}], "question": "What name refers to the Polabian-Pomeranian Slavs?", "id": "5ad504705b96ef001a10a9c1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "caliph", "answer_start": 314}], "question": "Who served as the guards of the Saqaliba?", "id": "5ad504705b96ef001a10a9c2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the 12th century", "answer_start": 334}], "question": "When did the Polabian Slavs settle in England?", "id": "5ad504705b96ef001a10a9c3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1147", "answer_start": 473}], "question": "When did Niklot invade Slavic lands?", "id": "5ad504705b96ef001a10a9c4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Polabian Slavs (Wends) settled in parts of England (Danelaw), apparently as Danish allies.
