In the year 2011 two IPCC Special Report were finalized , the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation ( SRREN ) and the Special Report on Managing Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation ( SREX ) . Both Special Reports were requested by governments .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O U-MISC O O O B-MISC L-MISC O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O U-MISC O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What other activities does the UNFCCC require the IPCC to run?", "id": "572940246aef051400154bec", "answers": [{"text": "the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme", "answer_start": 329}, {"text": "Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme", "answer_start": 333}, {"text": "Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme", "answer_start": 333}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is used to estimate emissions?", "id": "572940246aef051400154bed", "answers": [{"text": "default emission factors", "answer_start": 465}, {"text": "default emission factors", "answer_start": 465}, {"text": "default emission factors", "answer_start": 465}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Levels of what things are used to determine emission factors?", "id": "572940246aef051400154bee", "answers": [{"text": "fuel consumption, industrial production and so on", "answer_start": 567}, {"text": "Greenhouse Gas Inventories", "answer_start": 375}, {"text": "fuel consumption, industrial production and so on", "answer_start": 567}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What councils assign tasks to the IPCC?", "id": "572940246aef051400154bef", "answers": [{"text": "WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council", "answer_start": 81}, {"text": "WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council", "answer_start": 81}, {"text": "WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council", "answer_start": 81}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "WMO Executive Council", "answer_start": 81}], "question": "Who runs the UNEP Council?", "id": "5a3e3aa9378766001a002509", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "IPCC", "answer_start": 4}], "question": "Which organization does the UNFCCC processes support?", "id": "5a3e3aa9378766001a00250a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "preparation of the assessment reports", "answer_start": 222}], "question": "What is one of the minor functions of the IPCC?", "id": "5a3e3aa9378766001a00250b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "UNFCCC", "answer_start": 432}], "question": "Who is responsible for running the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme?", "id": "5a3e3aa9378766001a00250c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gas Inventories Programme", "answer_start": 386}], "question": "What measures the levels of fuel consumption?", "id": "5a3e3aa9378766001a00250d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The IPCC concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process.

Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic , which he mis - identified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report , and argued that \" Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report , the IPCC presented the ' Hockey Stick ' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt U - turn since its 1995 report \" . Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper , which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy , was picked up by the Bush administration , and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that \" manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people \" . The data and methodology used to produce the \" hockey stick graph \" was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick , and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl & Ammann 2007 , which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O B-LOC I-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-MISC O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O U-ORG O O U-LOC U-MISC O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O U-PER O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who was the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce?", "id": "572943ab1d04691400779219", "answers": [{"text": "Rep.
