Another example was the short - lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities , and the debates surrounding that adoption , which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change . There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities . Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged , when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability , and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What type of epistemology served as the foundation of knowledge constructions and  training scholars in universities?", "id": "5731a4580fdd8d15006c6421", "answers": [{"text": "Aristotelian", "answer_start": 215}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The scientific revolution contributed to what, in terms of science?", "id": "5731a4580fdd8d15006c6422", "answers": [{"text": "autonomy", "answer_start": 582}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "There was disagreement between universities and scientists over schools focusing on science, and the idea of what?", "id": "5731a4580fdd8d15006c6423", "answers": [{"text": "a general scholar", "answer_start": 949}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "A hierarchy of scientific disciplines came out of what?", "id": "5731a4580fdd8d15006c6424", "answers": [{"text": "the scientific revolution", "answer_start": 448}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where did students after the scientific revolution put science on the scale of importance?", "id": "5731a4580fdd8d15006c6425", "answers": [{"text": "first", "answer_start": 814}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Aristotelian", "answer_start": 215}], "question": "What type of epistemology served as the foundation of knowledge constructions and training students in universities?", "id": "5a77acd1b73996001af5a4ef", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "autonomy", "answer_start": 582}], "question": "What did the scientific scholar contribute to, in terms of science?", "id": "5a77acd1b73996001af5a4f0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the scientific revolution", "answer_start": 448}], "question": "What resulted in a hierarchy of scholars?", "id": "5a77acd1b73996001af5a4f1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "first", "answer_start": 814}], "question": "Where did scholars after the scientific revolution put science on the scale of importance?", "id": "5a77acd1b73996001af5a4f2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the way that university education was constructed", "answer_start": 164}], "question": "What was there an indiscernible impact on?", "id": "5a77acd1b73996001af5a4f3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed.
