Its aircraft \u2014 Dornier Do 17 , Junkers Ju 88 , and Heinkel He 111s \u2014 were capable of carrying out strategic missions , but were incapable of doing greater damage because of bomb - load limitations . The Luftwaffe 's decision in the interwar period to concentrate on medium bombers can be attributed to several reasons : Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939 ; the OKL believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a heavy bomber force ; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four - engined bombers before the war .", "tags": "O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O U-MISC O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Poor intelligence and what other problem made it difficult for the Luftwaffe to do extreme damage?", "id": "572f8b28b2c2fd14005681cd", "answers": [{"text": "unclear strategy", "answer_start": 97}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year did the OKL become aware that Britain would be a possible target?", "id": "572f8b28b2c2fd14005681ce", "answers": [{"text": "early 1938", "answer_start": 224}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What disagreements did the  Luftwaffe staff center around?", "id": "572f8b28b2c2fd14005681cf", "answers": [{"text": "tactics", "answer_start": 840}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the disputes between the staff cause to happen to the strategy against Britain?", "id": "572f8b28b2c2fd14005681d0", "answers": [{"text": "failure before it began", "answer_start": 915}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage, the problem for the Luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence.

Outside the capital , there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft , as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham , Coventry and Liverpool , but no major raids . The London docks and railways communications had taken a heavy pounding , and much damage had been done to the railway system outside . In September , there had been no less than 667 hits on railways in Great Britain , and at one period , between 5,000 and 6,000 wagons were standing idle from the effect of delayed action bombs . But the great bulk of the traffic went on ; and Londoners \u2014 though they glanced apprehensively each morning at the list of closed stretches of line displayed at their local station , or made strange detours round back streets in the buses \u2014 still got to work . For all the destruction of life and property , the observers sent out by the Ministry of Home Security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale . More than 13,000 civilians had been killed , and almost 20,000 injured , in September and October alone , but the death toll was much less than expected .
