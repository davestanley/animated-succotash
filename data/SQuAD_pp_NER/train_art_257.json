By the early 20th century , four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution , but fundamentalism inspired the American creation \u2013 evolution controversy that began in the 1920s . Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century , but other Catholic writers , starting with Mivart , pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area . The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical , which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O U-PER O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What branching common descent theory has become the most unifying one of the life sciences?", "id": "5727de2c4b864d1900163edc", "answers": [{"text": "Darwin's theory of evolution", "answer_start": 49}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does the theory of evolution explain about living organisms?", "id": "5727de2c4b864d1900163edd", "answers": [{"text": "The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment.", "answer_start": 207}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what fields has Darwin's theory of evolution become particularly essential?", "id": "5727de2c4b864d1900163ede", "answers": [{"text": "medicine and agriculture", "answer_start": 564}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of controversy has begun within school systems about Darwin's theory?", "id": "5727de2c4b864d1900163edf", "answers": [{"text": "a religion-based political controversy", "answer_start": 624}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Modern evolutionary theory continues to develop.
