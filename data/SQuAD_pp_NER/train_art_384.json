Ibn Tufail wrote the first Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan ( Philosophus Autodidactus ) as a response to Al - Ghazali 's The Incoherence of the Philosophers , and then Ibn al - Nafis also wrote a novel Theologus Autodidactus as a response to Ibn Tufail 's Philosophus Autodidactus . Both of these narratives had protagonists ( Hayy in Philosophus Autodidactus and Kamil in Theologus Autodidactus ) who were autodidactic feral children living in seclusion on a desert island , both being the earliest examples of a desert island story . However , while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in Philosophus Autodidactus , the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in Theologus Autodidactus , developing into the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel .", "tags": "B-PER L-PER O U-ORG O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O U-MISC O B-PER I-PER L-PER O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O U-PER O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O B-PER L-PER O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O U-PER O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What was the life span of Ibn al-Nafis?", "id": "572ff126947a6a140053ce40", "answers": [{"text": "1213\u20131288", "answer_start": 70}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of book is Theologus Autodidactus the first type of?", "id": "572ff126947a6a140053ce41", "answers": [{"text": "science fiction", "answer_start": 108}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Ibn al-Nafis use to explain the events in Theologus Autodidactus?", "id": "572ff126947a6a140053ce42", "answers": [{"text": "scientific knowledge", "answer_start": 433}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Theologus Autodidactus", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What did Ibn al-Nafis write in the 12th century?", "id": "5a54243bbdaabd001a38684c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ibn al-Nafis", "answer_start": 56}], "question": "Who wrote a science fiction novel in the 12th century?", "id": "5a54243bbdaabd001a38684d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "spontaneous generation, futurology, the end of the world and doomsday, resurrection, and the afterlife", "answer_start": 186}], "question": "What events did Ibn al-Nafis give supernatural or mythological explanations?", "id": "5a54243bbdaabd001a38684e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ibn al-Nafis", "answer_start": 518}], "question": "Who used mythology to explain Islamic teachings?", "id": "5a54243bbdaabd001a38684f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Theologus Autodidactus, written by the Arabian polymath Ibn al-Nafis (1213\u20131288), is the first example of a science fiction novel.
