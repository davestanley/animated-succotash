After breathing the gas himself , he wrote : \" The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air , but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards . \" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \" An Account of Further Discoveries in Air \" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air .

In nature , singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis , using the energy of sunlight . It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength , and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen .
