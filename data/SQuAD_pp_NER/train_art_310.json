Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios , Boeotia alone . The last stage in the development of the Kouros type is the late archaic period ( 520\u2013485 BC ) , in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole . Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze Piraeus Apollo . It was found in Piraeus , the harbour of Athens . The statue originally held the bow in its left hand , and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand . It probably comes from north - eastern Peloponnesus . The emphasis is given in anatomy , and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion , and beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post - Archaic art . The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which , with an independently developed harder , simpler , and heavier style , restricts Ionian influence in Athens .
