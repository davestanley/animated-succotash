Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s , and as of 2014 , remains on the World Health Organizations list of essential medications . The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers . Today , amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy .", "tags": "O O B-PER I-PER L-PER O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who developed Arsphenamine?", "id": "571aa3cb4faf5e1900b8ab8e", "answers": [{"text": "Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim", "answer_start": 80}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the first effective treatment for Syphilis?", "id": "571aa3cb4faf5e1900b8ab8f", "answers": [{"text": "Arsphenamine", "answer_start": 609}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What complications are associated with Syphilis?", "id": "571aa3cb4faf5e1900b8ab90", "answers": [{"text": "severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death", "answer_start": 750}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is Amphetamine's market name?", "id": "571aa3cb4faf5e1900b8ab91", "answers": [{"text": "Institute of Experimental Therapy", "answer_start": 128}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where is the Institute of Experimental Therapy located?", "id": "571aa3cb4faf5e1900b8ab92", "answers": [{"text": "Berlin", "answer_start": 165}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the name of the first synthetic bacterial drug?", "id": "571cf51edd7acb1400e4c1c8", "answers": [{"text": "arsphenamine", "answer_start": 8}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Bacterial infections could be treated with medicines containing what kind of dye?", "id": "571cf51edd7acb1400e4c1c9", "answers": [{"text": "arsenic", "answer_start": 355}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Arsphenamine became the first treatment for what previously incurable disease?", "id": "571cf51edd7acb1400e4c1ca", "answers": [{"text": "syphilis", "answer_start": 669}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year was arsphenamine discovered?", "id": "571cf51edd7acb1400e4c1cb", "answers": [{"text": "1911", "answer_start": 3}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the commercial name of arsphenamine?", "id": "571cf51edd7acb1400e4c1cc", "answers": [{"text": "Salvarsan", "answer_start": 212}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim", "answer_start": 80}], "question": "Who developed commercial ulceration?", "id": "5ad35bb2604f3c001a3fde7b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Arsphenamine", "answer_start": 468}], "question": "What was the first effective treatment for Bertheim?", "id": "5ad35bb2604f3c001a3fde7c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "severe skin ulceration, neurological damage", "answer_start": 750}], "question": "What complications are associated with Bertheim?", "id": "5ad35bb2604f3c001a3fde7d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Institute of Experimental Therapy", "answer_start": 128}], "question": "What is Bertheim's market name?", "id": "5ad35bb2604f3c001a3fde7e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Berlin", "answer_start": 165}], "question": "Where is the Institute of Bertheim located?", "id": "5ad35bb2604f3c001a3fde7f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In 1911 arsphenamine, the first synthetic anti-infective drug, was developed by Paul Ehrlich and chemist Alfred Bertheim of the Institute of Experimental Therapy in Berlin.
