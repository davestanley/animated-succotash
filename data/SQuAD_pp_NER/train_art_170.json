Then on 25 November 1837 , Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt ( patent # 7849 ) , for use in asphalte pavement , having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with Frederick Walter Simms , who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain . Dr T. Lamb Phipson writes that his father , Samuel Ryland Phipson , a friend of Claridge , was also \" instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement ( in 1836 ) \" .

In Australian English , bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces . In Canadian English , the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil , while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product used to pave roads and manufacture roof shingles and various waterproofing products . Diluted bitumen ( diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines ) is known as dilbit in the Canadian petroleum industry , while bitumen \" upgraded \" to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit . Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi - solid form of petroleum . Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen . The tar sands of Alberta , Canada are a similar material .", "tags": "O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O U-LOC O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What pigment did 19th century artists use that was deemed unfavorably?", "id": "571b5ffb32177014007ea082", "answers": [{"text": "Bitumen", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did bitumen when used as a paint not do correctly?", "id": "571b5ffb32177014007ea083", "answers": [{"text": "solidifies", "answer_start": 298}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did even limited use of bitumen do to damage paintings?", "id": "571b5ffb32177014007ea084", "answers": [{"text": "deterioration", "answer_start": 510}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What artist's work i considered to be an example of the damaging effects of bitumen?", "id": "571b5ffb32177014007ea085", "answers": [{"text": "Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's", "answer_start": 645}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What major problem did bitumen as a pigment show itself to be?

The bitumen content varies from 83 % to 92 % ( soluble in carbon disulphide ) , with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ( ring & ball ) around 120 \u00b0 C . The insoluble matter , consisting mainly of silica ore , ranges from 8 % to 17 % .", "tags": "U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O U-LOC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "By what means can humans be exposed to bitumen?", "id": "571b6a2f9499d21900609c9f", "answers": [{"text": "fumes or skin", "answer_start": 66}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the nationally set limit for exposure of asphalt in a 15 minute period?", "id": "571b6a2f9499d21900609ca0", "answers": [{"text": "5 mg/m3", "answer_start": 204}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How must asphalt be treated to be workable?", "id": "571b6a2f9499d21900609ca1", "answers": [{"text": "heated or diluted", "answer_start": 289}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "At what temperatures is heated asphalt seen to be a greater health risk?", "id": "571b6a2f9499d21900609ca2", "answers": [{"text": "greater than 199 \u00b0C", "answer_start": 764}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What feature in the treatment of asphalt in the workplace causes the most potential danger?", "id": "571b6a2f9499d21900609ca3", "answers": [{"text": "temperature", "answer_start": 607}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "breathing in fumes or skin absorption", "answer_start": 53}], "question": "How can people be exposed to low temperatures while at work?", "id": "5ace7f2132bba1001ae4a83d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "produce a greater exposure risk", "answer_start": 808}], "question": "Temperatures higher than 300 degrees Celsius where shown to do what?", "id": "5ace7f2132bba1001ae4a83e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "5 mg/m3 over a 15-minute period", "answer_start": 204}], "question": "What is the REL set by the National Institute for Research on Cancer?", "id": "5ace7f2132bba1001ae4a83f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "IARC", "answer_start": 537}], "question": "What is the acronym for the International Agency for Research on Carcinogenic hazards?", "id": "5ace7f2132bba1001ae4a840", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "People can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption.
