' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed ]", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Political advantage is an attribute of which state policies?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54c", "answers": [{"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Colonialism often means a country doing what?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54d", "answers": [{"text": "taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 347}, {"text": "a conquest over an area", "answer_start": 700}, {"text": "the process of a country taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 322}, {"text": "dominating areas", "answer_start": 536}, {"text": "country taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 339}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How would one create an empire by means of Imperialism?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54e", "answers": [{"text": "conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1061}, {"text": "conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance", "answer_start": 1061}, {"text": "by conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1058}, {"text": "political and monetary dominance", "answer_start": 409}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "what do conquering people pass down to native populations?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54f", "answers": [{"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "the characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1399}, {"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is colonialism's core meaning?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c550", "answers": [{"text": "exploitation", "answer_start": 845}, {"text": "the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies", "answer_start": 841}, {"text": "the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered", "answer_start": 841}, {"text": "exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits", "answer_start": 845}, {"text": "exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered", "answer_start": 845}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 231}], "question": "Political disadvantage is an attribute of which state policies?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 347}], "question": " Colonialism never means a country doing what?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1061}], "question": " How would one create an empire by means of non-Imperialism?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}], "question": " what do conquering people take away from native populations?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "exploitation", "answer_start": 845}], "question": " What is colonialism's antithesis?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two.

Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease , even squeamishness , with the fact of power , specifically , Western power .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC B-PER I-PER L-PER O U-MISC B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O U-MISC O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O U-PER O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c600", "answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When were Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c601", "answers": [{"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "World War I", "answer_start": 368}, {"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "before World War I,", "answer_start": 361}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the military-political complex reflected upon within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c602", "answers": [{"text": "the 1950s", "answer_start": 616}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Hobson argued that imperialism was an international what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c603", "answers": [{"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How did Hobson argue to rid the world of imperialism?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c604", "answers": [{"text": "taxation", "answer_start": 808}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation", "answer_start": 725}, {"text": "domestic social reforms", "answer_start": 646}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation", "answer_start": 725}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation.", "answer_start": 725}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}], "question": "There is some debate that there is a not correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d8e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "before World War I,", "answer_start": 361}], "question": " When weren't Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d8f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}], "question": " When was the military-political complex reflected upon not within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d90", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}], "question": " Hobson argued that imperialism wasn't an international what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d91", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "taxation", "answer_start": 808}], "question": " How did Hobson argue to not rid the world of imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d92", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.
