The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army 's supply wagons . The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement . The Ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state - supervised markets , but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea - producing regions .", "tags": "U-PER O O O O O O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O B-LOC L-LOC O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O U-LOC O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O U-MISC O O O O U-MISC O O U-MISC O O O O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O U-LOC O O O U-LOC O O U-PER O U-PER O O O O O U-MISC O O U-MISC O O O O O U-PER O B-PER I-PER L-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O O O U-MISC O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why does Van Praag believe the Ming court set up a diplomatic delegation with Tibet?", "id": "56cd8d2762d2951400fa66de", "answers": [{"text": "to secure urgently needed horses", "answer_start": 90}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What shops were catered to the Tibetan market?", "id": "56cd8d2762d2951400fa66df", "answers": [{"text": "Silk workshops", "answer_start": 1980}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What visual images and symbols were on furnishings from the silk workshops?", "id": "56cd8d2762d2951400fa66e0", "answers": [{"text": "Tibetan Buddhist", "answer_start": 2103}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "who were the Tibetan areas were ruled by?", "id": "56cd8d2762d2951400fa66e1", "answers": [{"text": "the Ming", "answer_start": 22}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Wang and Nyima believed horses were collected from Tibet as what kind of tax?", "id": "56cd8d2762d2951400fa66e2", "answers": [{"text": "a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax", "answer_start": 343}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses.
