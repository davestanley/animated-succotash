In 1896 , the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll , Illinois . Under the terms of the affiliation , the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university , to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals , to make no faculty appointment without the university 's approval , and to send copies of examinations for suggestions . The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years , and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago . A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago , and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work . The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost ; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses ; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost . The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice . Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program , as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part , and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university .
