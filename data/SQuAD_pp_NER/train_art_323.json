During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad . Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism . The evidence supporting this claim is patchy : Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi\u0107 complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet\u2014 which was true , but was not proof of unequal rights , but of frequency of use and prestige . Babi\u0107 further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary ( 1967 ) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed , which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants , and not of unitarism . Moreover , Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists . And finally , Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rje\u010dnik came from the Croatian Philological Society . Regardless of these facts , Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967 . On occasion of the publication \u2019s 45th anniversary , the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012 , accompanied by a critical analysis .", "tags": "O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O B-PER L-PER O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O U-PER O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O U-PER O O U-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC L-LOC O U-LOC O B-MISC L-MISC O B-LOC L-LOC O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O B-PER L-PER O O O O O O U-LOC O O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-PER O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O U-MISC O O O U-MISC O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O U-ORG O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which tense indicates that an action hasn't finished?", "id": "572a0f656aef05140015521c", "answers": [{"text": "imperfective", "answer_start": 255}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which two states do Shtokavian verbs have?", "id": "572a0f656aef05140015521d", "answers": [{"text": "perfective or imperfective", "answer_start": 90}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When is the perspective aspect of a verb used?", "id": "572a0f656aef05140015521e", "answers": [{"text": "action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration", "answer_start": 409}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "perfective or imperfective", "answer_start": 90}], "question": "What are two aspects the Kajkavian verb has?", "id": "5a2c685cbfd06b001a5aeb63", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "pairs", "answer_start": 137}], "question": "What do prefixes come in usually?", "id": "5a2c685cbfd06b001a5aeb64", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the imperfective", "answer_start": 190}], "question": "What is the stem change created out of?", "id": "5a2c685cbfd06b001a5aeb65", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a particular aspect", "answer_start": 529}], "question": "What do some Shtokavian verbs favor?", "id": "5a2c685cbfd06b001a5aeb66", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the relative lack of tenses", "answer_start": 642}], "question": "What do limited duration actions compensate for?", "id": "5a2c685cbfd06b001a5aeb67", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In addition, like most Slavic languages, the Shtokavian verb also has one of two aspects: perfective or imperfective.
