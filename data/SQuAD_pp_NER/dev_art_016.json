Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications , including more specialized medications , than would be feasible in the community setting . Most hospital medications are unit - dose , or a single dose of medicine . Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) , and other medications given intravenously . This is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel , quality assurance of products , and adequate facilities . Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding . The high cost of medications and drug - related technology , combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient - care outcomes and patient safety , make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible .", "tags": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What do the services given by pharmacists provide?", "id": "5726e3c4dd62a815002e9404", "answers": [{"text": "optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention", "answer_start": 54}, {"text": "optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention", "answer_start": 54}, {"text": "direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention", "answer_start": 20}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the origin of clinical pharmacy?", "id": "5726e3c4dd62a815002e9405", "answers": [{"text": "inside hospitals and clinics", "answer_start": 260}, {"text": "inside hospitals and clinics", "answer_start": 260}, {"text": "the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics", "answer_start": 213}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who do clinical pharmacists work with much of the time?", "id": "5726e3c4dd62a815002e9406", "answers": [{"text": "physicians and other healthcare professionals", "answer_start": 334}, {"text": "physicians", "answer_start": 334}, {"text": "physicians and other healthcare professionals", "answer_start": 334}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do clinical pharmacists often participate in?", "id": "5726e3c4dd62a815002e9407", "answers": [{"text": "patient care rounds drug product selection", "answer_start": 535}, {"text": "interdisciplinary approach", "answer_start": 465}, {"text": "patient care rounds drug product selection", "answer_start": 535}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where do clinical pharmacists work with patients?", "id": "5726e3c4dd62a815002e9408", "answers": [{"text": "all health care settings", "answer_start": 183}, {"text": "drug product selection", "answer_start": 555}, {"text": "all health care settings", "answer_start": 183}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "inside hospitals and clinics", "answer_start": 260}], "question": "What is not the origin of clinical pharmacy?", "id": "5a6ce4164eec6b001a80a680", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "physicians and other healthcare professionals", "answer_start": 334}], "question": "Who do clinical pharmacists never work with?", "id": "5a6ce4164eec6b001a80a681", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "patient care rounds drug product selection", "answer_start": 535}], "question": "What do clinical pharmacists not participate in?", "id": "5a6ce4164eec6b001a80a682", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "all health care settings", "answer_start": 183}], "question": "Where are clinical pharmacists not allowed to work with patients?", "id": "5a6ce4164eec6b001a80a683", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention.
