YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program , with 55 percent going to the uploader . There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program . According to TubeMogul , in 2013 a pre - roll advertisement on YouTube ( one that is shown before the video starts ) cost advertisers on average $ 7.60 per 1000 views . Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre - roll advertisement , due to a lack of interested advertisers . Assuming pre - roll advertisements on half of videos , a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $ 7.60 X 55 % = $ 2.09 per 1000 views in 2013 .", "tags": "O O O O U-ORG O O B-MISC L-MISC O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG L-ORG O O O U-ORG O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where does the majority of youtube's revenue go?", "id": "5731b52eb9d445190005e489", "answers": [{"text": "to the copyright holders", "answer_start": 31}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In 2010 what were the estimates for the amount of videos with advertisements uploaded without the copywriter's consent?", "id": "5731b52eb9d445190005e48a", "answers": [{"text": "nearly a third", "answer_start": 100}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which major gaming company claimed copyright ad revenue rights against uploaders?", "id": "5731b52eb9d445190005e48b", "answers": [{"text": "Nintendo", "answer_start": 508}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Nintendo finally agree to share ad profits with the original uploaders?", "id": "5731b52eb9d445190005e48c", "answers": [{"text": "February 2015", "answer_start": 493}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What option besides removing the video does youtube grant copyright holders?", "id": "5731b52eb9d445190005e48d", "answers": [{"text": "have them continue running for revenue", "answer_start": 294}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "its copyright ownership", "answer_start": 372}], "question": "What did Nintendo start enforcing in 2015?", "id": "5ace370d32bba1001ae49eb5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "revenue", "answer_start": 537}], "question": "What did Nintendo agree to share in 2013?", "id": "5ace370d32bba1001ae49eb6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "nearly a third", "answer_start": 100}], "question": "How many videos with advertisements were uploaded without the copyright holder's permission in 2013?", "id": "5ace370d32bba1001ae49eb7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Much of YouTube's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos.
