Earlier coal-gas methods had been used for lighting since the 1820s, but they were expensive. Gesner's kerosene was cheap, easy to produce, could be burned in existing lamps, and did not produce an offensive odor as did most whale oil. It could be stored indefinitely, unlike whale oil, which would eventually spoil. The American petroleum boom began in the 1850s. By the end of the decade there were 30 kerosene plants operating in the United States. The cheaper, more efficient fuel began to drive whale oil out of the market. John D. Rockefeller was most responsible for the commercial success of kerosene. He set up a network of kerosene distilleries which would later become Standard Oil, thus completely abolishing the need for whale-oil lamps.

Earlier coal - gas methods had been used for lighting since the 1820s , but they were expensive . Gesner 's kerosene was cheap , easy to produce , could be burned in existing lamps , and did not produce an offensive odor as did most whale oil . It could be stored indefinitely , unlike whale oil , which would eventually spoil . The American petroleum boom began in the 1850s . By the end of the decade there were 30 kerosene plants operating in the United States . The cheaper , more efficient fuel began to drive whale oil out of the market . John D.
