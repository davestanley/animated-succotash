During the Akkadian and Ur III phases , there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt - tolerant barley , but this was insufficient , and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC , it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths . This greatly upset the balance of power within the region , weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken , and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language .
