Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 20 m / s ( 4,000 ft / min ) , A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor . This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically ; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling ( see inherent safety and safety engineering ) . But it can also be some form of disc type like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed , high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace 's EcoDisc which is not high speed , high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine ) for breaking power , compactness and redundancy(assuming there 's at least 2 calipers on the disc ) , or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness , breaking power , and redundancy(assuming there 's 2 brakes or more ) .", "tags": "U-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-ORG O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O U-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What reduces the amount of force needed to propel the cab?", "id": "572ea56bcb0c0d14000f13dc", "answers": [{"text": "cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab", "answer_start": 14}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where will the counterweight be found?", "id": "572ea56bcb0c0d14000f13dd", "answers": [{"text": "in the hoist-way", "answer_start": 292}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What guides the traction machine?", "id": "572ea56bcb0c0d14000f13de", "answers": [{"text": "the controller", "answer_start": 479}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The counterweight runs equal to the cab weight plus what percentage of the elevator capacity?", "id": "572ea56bcb0c0d14000f13df", "answers": [{"text": "40-50%", "answer_start": 716}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Maintaining that the ropes all have equal tension may reduce what?", "id": "572ea56bcb0c0d14000f13e0", "answers": [{"text": "Sheave and rope wear", "answer_start": 1082}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be \"underslung\" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab.
