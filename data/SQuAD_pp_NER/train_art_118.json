The Federal Reserve , which was established in 1913 , was designed to furnish an \" elastic \" currency subject to \" substantial changes of quantity over short periods \" , which differed significantly from previous forms of high - powered money such as gold , national bank notes , and silver coins . Over the very long run , the prior gold standard kept prices stable \u2014 for instance , the price level and the value of the U.S. dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s . The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the U.S. dollar and price stability , reversing the inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s , before presiding over a 30 % deflation in U.S. prices in the 1930s .", "tags": "O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG L-ORG O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC L-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O U-LOC O O O O O"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What would zero inflation mean for the US dollar over time?", "id": "5709bb3ded30961900e84458", "answers": [{"text": "constant value", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What would result in a slow declining of the value of the dollar over time?", "id": "5709bb3ded30961900e84459", "answers": [{"text": "low, stable inflation", "answer_start": 150}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who is in favor of a zero inflation policy?", "id": "5709bb3ded30961900e8445a", "answers": [{"text": "some economists", "answer_start": 287}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "A zero inflation policy would limit who's influence and ability to react?", "id": "5709bb3ded30961900e8445b", "answers": [{"text": "central bank", "answer_start": 455}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "With a zero inflation rate, what would the central bank be unable to do other than control interest rates?", "id": "5709bb3ded30961900e8445c", "answers": [{"text": "stimulate the economy", "answer_start": 498}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "constant value", "answer_start": 101}], "question": "What would zero inflation mean for control interest over time?", "id": "5a8cfcc1fd22b3001a8d90d0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "low, stable inflation", "answer_start": 150}], "question": "What would result in a slow declining of the value of control interest over time?", "id": "5a8cfcc1fd22b3001a8d90d1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "central bank", "answer_start": 455}], "question": "A zero inflation policy would limit who's influence and stimulate the economy?", "id": "5a8cfcc1fd22b3001a8d90d2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "stimulate the economy", "answer_start": 498}], "question": "With a zero inflation rate, what would stable inflation be unable to do other than control interest rates?", "id": "5a8cfcc1fd22b3001a8d90d3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "stable inflation", "answer_start": 155}], "question": "What would mean a continuously but slowly stimulating of the economy?", "id": "5a8cfcc1fd22b3001a8d90d4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "There is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation (which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over time) or low, stable inflation (which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time, as is the case now).
