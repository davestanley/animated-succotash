According to some translations from the original Greek , the thieves may have been bandits or Jewish rebels . According to Mark 's Gospel , he endured the torment of crucifixion for some six hours from the third hour , at approximately 9 am , until his death at the ninth hour , corresponding to about 3 pm . The soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating \" Jesus of Nazareth , King of the Jews \" in three languages , divided his garments and cast lots for his seamless robe . The Roman soldiers did not break Jesus ' legs , as they did to the other two men crucified ( breaking the legs hastened the crucifixion process ) , as Jesus was dead already . Each gospel has its own account of Jesus ' last words , seven statements altogether . In the Synoptic Gospels , various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion , including darkness , an earthquake , and ( in Matthew ) the resurrection of saints . Following Jesus ' death , his body was removed from the cross by Joseph of Arimathea and buried in a rock - hewn tomb , with Nicodemus assisting .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What detail of Jesus's Crucifiction was only found in Matthew's Gospel?", "id": "57277589dd62a815002e9d5a", "answers": [{"text": "an earthquake", "answer_start": 122}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which gospel mentioned the time of Crucifiction?", "id": "57277589dd62a815002e9d5b", "answers": [{"text": "Mark", "answer_start": 240}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Jesus talk to in the Gospel of Luke?", "id": "57277589dd62a815002e9d5c", "answers": [{"text": "words to the women who were mourning", "answer_start": 449}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What gospel talks about breaking Jesus' legs?", "id": "57277589dd62a815002e9d5d", "answers": [{"text": "John", "answer_start": 664}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What prophecy was fulfilled by the piercing of Jesus' side?", "id": "57277589dd62a815002e9d5e", "answers": [{"text": "Old Testament prophecy", "answer_start": 810}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the third hour, or 9 am", "answer_start": 306}], "question": "What time did the Romans decide to guard the tomb of Jesus?", "id": "5a8c753efd22b3001a8d8820", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the women", "answer_start": 458}], "question": "Who did the Roman soldiers speak to when they were in mourning?", "id": "5a8c753efd22b3001a8d8821", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rebuke", "answer_start": 502}], "question": "What did one Roman soldier do to chastise the other?", "id": "5a8c753efd22b3001a8d8822", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "\"beating their breasts\"", "answer_start": 563}], "question": "What did the Roman soldiers do to celebrate their victory?", "id": "5a8c753efd22b3001a8d8823", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "spices and ointments", "answer_start": 612}], "question": "What did the Romans use when one of their soldiers had an injury?", "id": "5a8c753efd22b3001a8d8824", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "There are several details that are only found in one of the gospel accounts.

Some scholars explain a Thursday crucifixion based on a \" double sabbath \" caused by an extra Passover sabbath falling on Thursday dusk to Friday afternoon , ahead of the normal weekly Sabbath . Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday , not Friday , on the grounds of the mention of \" three days and three nights \" in Matthew before his resurrection , celebrated on Sunday . Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a \" day and night \" may refer to any part of a 24-hour period , that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic , not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb , and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What time was the crucifiction per Mark?", "id": "57277e3cf1498d1400e8f9b2", "answers": [{"text": "9 a.m.", "answer_start": 57}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What time did Jesus die per Mark?", "id": "57277e3cf1498d1400e8f9b3", "answers": [{"text": "3 p.m.", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why do scholars say the times are different depending on the gospel it's written in?", "id": "57277e3cf1498d1400e8f9b4", "answers": [{"text": "based on the use of Roman timekeeping in John but not in Mark", "answer_start": 291}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is another reason the times differ so much?", "id": "57277e3cf1498d1400e8f9b5", "answers": [{"text": "no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available", "answer_start": 557}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How close was time guessed in the day of the Gospels?", "id": "57277e3cf1498d1400e8f9b6", "answers": [{"text": "approximated to the closest three-hour period", "answer_start": 665}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "(9 a.m.)", "answer_start": 56}], "question": "What time did Pilate hold court in the morning?", "id": "5a8c819efd22b3001a8d8984", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "standardization of timepieces", "answer_start": 560}], "question": "What did Pilate call for to make it easier to tell time?", "id": "5a8c819efd22b3001a8d8985", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "three-hour period", "answer_start": 693}], "question": "During what time period was Pilate avaliable to be seen?", "id": "5a8c819efd22b3001a8d8986", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a reconciliation", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "What did Pilate want with the Roman empire?", "id": "5a8c819efd22b3001a8d8987", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the arguments", "answer_start": 379}], "question": "What was rejected by Rome when Pilate brought reconciliation to the table?", "id": "5a8c819efd22b3001a8d8988", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In Mark 15:25 crucifixion takes place at the third hour (9 a.m.) and Jesus' death at the ninth hour (3 p.m.).
