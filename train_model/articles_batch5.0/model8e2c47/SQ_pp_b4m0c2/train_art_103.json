On June 2 , 1876 the garrisons in the state of Chihuahua surrendered to the authority of General Porfirio D\u00edaz ; Governor Antonio Ochoa was arrested until all the Lerdista forces were suppressed throughout the state . Porfirio D\u00edaz then helped T\u00edras regain the governorship of the state of Chihuahua allowing for the Plan of Tuxtepec to be implemented . The victory of the Plan of Tuxtepec , gave the interim presidency to Jose Maria Iglesias and later , as the only candidate , the General Porfirio D\u00edaz assumed the presidency on May 5 , 1877 . During the first years of the Porfiriato ( Porfirio D\u00edaz Era ) , the D\u00edaz administration had to combat several attacks from the Lerdista forces and the Apache . A new rebellion led by the Lerdista party was orchestrated from exile in the United States . The Lerdista forces were able to temporarily occupy the city of El Paso del Norte until mid-1877 . During 1877 the northern parts of the state suffered through a spell of extreme drought which were responsible for many deaths in El Paso del Norte .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which year did Orozco revolt?", "id": "57070e6c9e06ca38007e934b", "answers": [{"text": "1912", "answer_start": 9}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who notified Huerta the revolt had been put down?", "id": "57070e6c9e06ca38007e934c", "answers": [{"text": "Villa", "answer_start": 304}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who saved Villa's life?", "id": "57070e6c9e06ca38007e934d", "answers": [{"text": "Ra\u00fal Madero", "answer_start": 523}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "With whom did Orozco side?", "id": "57070e6c9e06ca38007e934e", "answers": [{"text": "Huerta", "answer_start": 764}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In March 1912, in Chihuahua, Gen.

Tr\u00edas took the opportunity to dedicate important state resources to gain economic concessions from the people and loans from many municipalities in preparation to defend the state ; he used all the money he received to equip and organize a large volunteer militia . \u00c1ngel Tr\u00edas took measures for state self - dependence in regards to state militia due to the diminishing financial support from the federal government .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which city became the launching place for expeditions into New Mexico?", "id": "570714f39e06ca38007e93c3", "answers": [{"text": "Santa B\u00e1rbara", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which year was El Paso del Norte found?", "id": "570714f39e06ca38007e93c4", "answers": [{"text": "1598", "answer_start": 316}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The path was important for the expansion of which road?", "id": "570714f39e06ca38007e93c5", "answers": [{"text": "El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro", "answer_start": 530}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which U.S. state benefited from this road?", "id": "570714f39e06ca38007e93c6", "answers": [{"text": "New Mexico", "answer_start": 732}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Santa B\u00e1rbara became the launching place for expeditions into New Mexico by Spanish conquistadors like: Antonio de Espejo, Gaspar Casta\u00f1o, Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez de Uma\u00f1a, Francisco Leyba de Bonilla, and Vicente de Zald\u00edvar.
