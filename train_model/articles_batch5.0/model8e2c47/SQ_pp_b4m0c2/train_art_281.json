Northwestern 's athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats . Before 1924 , they were known as \" The Purple \" and unofficially as \" The Fighting Methodists . \" The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey , a writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the University of Chicago , \" Football players had not come down from Evanston ; wildcats would be a name better suited to [ Coach Glenn ] Thistletwaite 's boys . \" The name was so popular that university board members made \" wildcats \" the official nickname just months later . In 1972 , the student body voted to change the official nickname from \" Wildcats \" to \" Purple Haze \" but the new name never stuck .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who is the mascot of Northwestern Athletics?", "id": "57280cfc3acd2414000df323", "answers": [{"text": "Willie the Wildcat", "answer_start": 40}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the first mascot of Northwestern Athletics?", "id": "57280cfc3acd2414000df324", "answers": [{"text": "a live, caged bear cub from the Lincoln Park Zoo", "answer_start": 91}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the name of Northwestern Athletics's bear cub mascot?", "id": "57280cfc3acd2414000df325", "answers": [{"text": "Furpaw", "answer_start": 146}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did the athletic team blame for it's first losing season?", "id": "57280cfc3acd2414000df326", "answers": [{"text": "Furpaw", "answer_start": 281}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the athletic team do with Furpaw after they lost the first season?", "id": "57280cfc3acd2414000df327", "answers": [{"text": "banished him from campus forever", "answer_start": 321}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Willie the Wildcat", "answer_start": 40}], "question": "Who is the mascot of Southwestern Athletics?", "id": "5ad2d117d7d075001a42a342", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "live, caged bear cub", "answer_start": 93}], "question": " What was the second mascot of Northwestern Athletics?", "id": "5ad2d117d7d075001a42a343", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Furpaw", "answer_start": 281}], "question": "What was the name of Southwestern Athletics's bear cub mascot?", "id": "5ad2d117d7d075001a42a344", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Furpaw", "answer_start": 281}], "question": " Who did the athletic team blame for it's first losing season?", "id": "5ad2d117d7d075001a42a345", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "banished him from campus forever", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "What did the athletic team do with Furpaw after they lost the third season?", "id": "5ad2d117d7d075001a42a346", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The mascot of Northwestern Athletics is Willie the Wildcat.
