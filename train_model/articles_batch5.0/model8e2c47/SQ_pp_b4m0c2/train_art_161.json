The philosophic movement was led by Voltaire and Jean - Jacques Rousseau , who argued for a society based upon reason rather than faith and Catholic doctrine , for a new civil order based on natural law , and for science based on experiments and observation . The political philosopher Montesquieu introduced the idea of a separation of powers in a government , a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution .

One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the \" consent of the governed \" philosophy as delineated by Locke in Two Treatises of Government ( 1689 ) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the \" divine right of kings \" . In this view , the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully , and therefore violent revolution was the result . Clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what work did Ferguson explain how humans advanced from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without \"signing\" a social contract?", "id": "5710e166a58dae1900cd6b1e", "answers": [{"text": "An Essay on the History of Civil Society", "answer_start": 677}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Ferguson publish An Essay on the History of Civil Society?", "id": "5710e166a58dae1900cd6b1f", "answers": [{"text": "1767", "answer_start": 672}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many stages of progress did Ferguson theorize?", "id": "5710e166a58dae1900cd6b20", "answers": [{"text": "four", "answer_start": 737}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who, along with Adam Ferguson, criticized the idea of social contract theorists?", "id": "5710e166a58dae1900cd6b21", "answers": [{"text": "David Hume", "answer_start": 96}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Though much of Enlightenment political thought was dominated by social contract theorists, both David Hume and Adam Ferguson criticized this camp.
