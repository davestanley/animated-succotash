Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a standard test configuration procedure , the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group ( JTAG ) standard . The JTAG test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical test probes . JTAG tool vendors provide various types of stimulus and sophisticated algorithms , not only to detect the failing nets , but also to isolate the faults to specific nets , devices , and pins .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "If a PCB is intended for use in an setting with extreme conditions, what would probably be applied?", "id": "572fe1edb2c2fd1400568553", "answers": [{"text": "conformal coating", "answer_start": 52}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "A conformal coating can be applied by spraying the PCB or by doing what else to it?", "id": "572fe1edb2c2fd1400568554", "answers": [{"text": "dipping", "answer_start": 91}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The conformal coating can prevent leaking, shorts, and what other type of moisture damage?", "id": "572fe1edb2c2fd1400568555", "answers": [{"text": "corrosion", "answer_start": 170}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What material was first used for conformal coating?", "id": "572fe1edb2c2fd1400568556", "answers": [{"text": "wax", "answer_start": 268}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What action is made much more difficult for boards that have a conformal coating?", "id": "572fe1edb2c2fd1400568557", "answers": [{"text": "servicing", "answer_start": 555}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "extreme", "answer_start": 18}], "question": "PABs are intended for what type of environment?", "id": "5ace83bd32bba1001ae4a915", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a conformal coating", "answer_start": 50}], "question": "What type of coat encourages corrosion?", "id": "5ace83bd32bba1001ae4a916", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult", "answer_start": 555}], "question": "The chief advantage to conformal coatings is what?", "id": "5ace83bd32bba1001ae4a917", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "modern conformal coats", "answer_start": 273}], "question": "Which coatings are usually dips of dilute solutions of wax rubber?", "id": "5ace83bd32bba1001ae4a918", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "PCBs intended for extreme environments often have a conformal coating, which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered.

The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.", "allenNER": {"words": "Originally , every electronic component had wire leads , and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component . The components ' leads were then passed through the holes and soldered to the PCB trace . This method of assembly is called through - hole construction . In 1949 , Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto - Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered .
