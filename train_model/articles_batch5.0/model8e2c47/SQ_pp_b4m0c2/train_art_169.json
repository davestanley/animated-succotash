Abu Sufyan sought to exterminate the adherents of the new religion by waging another battle with Muslims based in Medina only a year after the Battle of Badr . He did this to avenge the defeat at Badr . The Battle of Uhud is generally believed by scholars to be the first defeat for the Muslims , as they had incurred greater losses than the Meccans . After the battle , Abu Sufyan 's wife Hind , who was also the daughter of Utba ibn Rabi'ah , is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza , taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat . Within five years after his defeat in the Battle of Uhud , however , Muhammad took control of Mecca and announced a general amnesty for all . Abu Sufyan and his wife Hind embraced Islam on the eve of the conquest of Mecca , as did their son ( the future caliph Muawiyah I ) .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What tax did non-Muslims pay in the Umayyad period?", "id": "571aa18a4faf5e1900b8ab66", "answers": [{"text": "jizyah", "answer_start": 356}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was another term for Muslims who were not Arab?", "id": "571aa18a4faf5e1900b8ab67", "answers": [{"text": "mawali", "answer_start": 758}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with Christians and Jews, what was a major non-Muslim religious group under the Umayyads?", "id": "571aa18a4faf5e1900b8ab68", "answers": [{"text": "Zoroastrian", "answer_start": 217}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "jizyah", "answer_start": 356}], "question": "What tax did Muslims pay in the Umayyad period?", "id": "5acfafc277cf76001a685860", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "mawali", "answer_start": 758}], "question": "What was a term for Arabs who were not Muslim?", "id": "5acfafc277cf76001a685861", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "provincial governors", "answer_start": 549}], "question": "Who encouraged conversions in order to make more revenue?", "id": "5acfafc277cf76001a685862", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Umar", "answer_start": 629}], "question": "Who insisted on different treatment of Arab and non-Arab Muslims?", "id": "5acfafc277cf76001a685863", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Umar", "answer_start": 629}], "question": "Who added more obstacles to conversion to Islam for non-Arabs?", "id": "5acfafc277cf76001a685864", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Umar is honored for his attempt to resolve the fiscal problems attendant upon conversion to Islam.

Following the Umayyad defeat in the \" Day of Thirst \" in 724 , Ashras ibn ' Abd Allah al - Sulami , governor of Khurasan , promised tax relief to those Sogdians who converted to Islam , but went back on his offer when it proved too popular and threatened to reduce tax revenues . Discontent among the Khurasani Arabs rose sharply after the losses suffered in the Battle of the Defile in 731 , and in 734 , al - Harith ibn Surayj led a revolt that received broad backing from Arabs and natives alike , capturing Balkh but failing to take Merv . After this defeat , al - Harith 's movement seems to have been dissolved , but the problem of the rights of non - Arab Muslims would continue to plague the Umayyads .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What group were the Hashimiyya a sect of?", "id": "571aa46c10f8ca140030523b", "answers": [{"text": "Kaysanites Shia", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who led the Hashimiyya movement?", "id": "571aa46c10f8ca140030523c", "answers": [{"text": "Abbasid family", "answer_start": 72}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Of what clan were the Abbasids members of?", "id": "571aa46c10f8ca140030523d", "answers": [{"text": "Hashim", "answer_start": 154}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year saw the death of Abu Hashim?", "id": "571aa46c10f8ca140030523e", "answers": [{"text": "717", "answer_start": 368}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was named successor by Abu Hashim?", "id": "571aa46c10f8ca140030523f", "answers": [{"text": "Muhammad ibn Ali", "answer_start": 472}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Kaysanites Shia", "answer_start": 43}], "question": "What was a sub-sect of the Hashimiyya movement?", "id": "5acfb3c477cf76001a685980", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Abbasid family", "answer_start": 68}], "question": "Who led the Kaysanites Shia?", "id": "5acfb3c477cf76001a685981", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Muhammad ibn Ali", "answer_start": 472}], "question": "Who named Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya as his successor?", "id": "5acfb3c477cf76001a685982", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "This tradition", "answer_start": 507}], "question": "What failed to rally the supporters of the failed revolt?", "id": "5acfb3c477cf76001a685983", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the supporters of the failed revolt of Mukhtar", "answer_start": 552}], "question": "Who represented themselves as the supporters of Ali?", "id": "5acfb3c477cf76001a685984", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Hashimiyya movement (a sub-sect of the Kaysanites Shia), led by the Abbasid family, overthrew the Umayyad caliphate.
