Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale , although by the 7th century AD , beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries . During the Industrial Revolution , the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture , and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century . The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results .", "tags": "0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the main cause for the bitterness in beer?", "id": "570a3bf74103511400d595da", "answers": [{"text": "Hops", "answer_start": 66}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the main goals for the sweetness of beer?", "id": "570a3bf74103511400d595db", "answers": [{"text": "malt", "answer_start": 130}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is the bitterness in most beers generally measured?", "id": "570a3bf74103511400d595dc", "answers": [{"text": "the International Bitterness Units scale", "answer_start": 175}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The acidity of what ingredient acts as a preservative in beer?", "id": "570a3bf74103511400d595dd", "answers": [{"text": "hops", "answer_start": 515}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do you call the length of time that foam is on top of beer because of carbonation?", "id": "570a3bf74103511400d595de", "answers": [{"text": "head retention", "answer_start": 412}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "several characteristics", "answer_start": 13}], "question": "What does beer contain that brewers desire in hops?", "id": "5acd703107355d001abf422c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "bitterness of beers", "answer_start": 140}], "question": "What is measured by the Bitterness International Units scale?", "id": "5acd703107355d001abf422d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last.", "answer_start": 429}], "question": "What is retention head?", "id": "5acd703107355d001abf422e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antibiotic effect", "answer_start": 302}], "question": "What type of effect do floral hops have?", "id": "5acd703107355d001abf422f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer.
