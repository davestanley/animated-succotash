Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting , the male bird being a doughty fighter . By 4,000 years ago , chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later , they arrived in Egypt . They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility . The Romans used them in divination , and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation . Since then , the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Are there any purebreed lines for poultry today?", "id": "57263eda271a42140099d7cb", "answers": [{"text": "with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin.", "answer_start": 91}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the poultry business boom in the United States ?", "id": "57263eda271a42140099d7cc", "answers": [{"text": "By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry", "answer_start": 402}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How has breeding helped in the pultry industry?", "id": "57263eda271a42140099d7cd", "answers": [{"text": "light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption", "answer_start": 595}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How can you normally identify a cock when recently hatched?", "id": "57263eda271a42140099d7ce", "answers": [{"text": "can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling", "answer_start": 877}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "chickens began to be kept on a larger scale", "answer_start": 191}], "question": "What began in 1820?", "id": "5a84d43f7cf838001a46aace", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "modern high-output poultry farms", "answer_start": 240}], "question": "What became present in the United Kingdom in 1900?", "id": "5a84d43f7cf838001a46aacf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the egg-laying industry", "answer_start": 494}], "question": "What was of greater importance than the poultry meat-producing industry in the mid-20th century?", "id": "5a84d43f7cf838001a46aad0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "300", "answer_start": 643}], "question": "How many eggs can male birds produce in a year?", "id": "5a84d43f7cf838001a46aad1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1920", "answer_start": 320}], "question": "What year did modern high-output poultry farms become established in the United States?", "id": "5a84d43f7cf838001a46aad2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "Why does no breeding for poultry exist today?", "id": "5a85c600b4e223001a8e7213", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the mid-20th century", "answer_start": 405}], "question": "When did the poultry business end permanently in the United States?", "id": "5a85c600b4e223001a8e7214", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption", "answer_start": 595}], "question": "How has breeding destroyed the poultry industry?", "id": "5a85c600b4e223001a8e7215", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "has more tender and flavorful meat", "answer_start": 1081}], "question": "How can you normally identify a cock when it doesn't hatch?", "id": "5a85c600b4e223001a8e7216", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Male birds", "answer_start": 822}], "question": "What birds are castrated to increase aggression?", "id": "5a85c600b4e223001a8e7217", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Since their domestication, a large number of breeds of chickens have been established, but with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin.

Two eggs are laid and incubated for about 17 days . When they hatch , the squabs are fed by both parents on \" pigeon 's milk \" , a thick secretion high in protein produced by the crop . Squabs grow rapidly , but are slow to fledge and are ready to leave the nest at 26 to 30 days weighing about 500 g ( 18 oz ) . By this time , the adult pigeons will have laid and be incubating another pair of eggs and a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a breeding season lasting several months .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the most popular type of poulty that is farmed?", "id": "572657b3708984140094c313", "answers": [{"text": "Worldwide, more chickens are kept than any other type of poultry", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many birds are routinely raised in the world for the consumption process?", "id": "572657b3708984140094c314", "answers": [{"text": "50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs.", "answer_start": 76}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is the cost of the price for animal feed related to the poulty cost for consumers?", "id": "572657b3708984140094c315", "answers": [{"text": "High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production", "answer_start": 810}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Before industrialization how were chickens normally cared for?", "id": "572657b3708984140094c316", "answers": [{"text": "birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night.", "answer_start": 166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the major significance of chickens to women in underdeveloped countries?", "id": "572657b3708984140094c317", "answers": [{"text": "the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry", "answer_start": 321}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "chickens", "answer_start": 16}], "question": "What is the worst type of poultry that is farmed?", "id": "5a860b8fb4e223001a8e73f7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs", "answer_start": 76}], "question": "How many birds are ritualistically sacrificed in the world for the consumption process?", "id": "5a860b8fb4e223001a8e73f8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production", "answer_start": 810}], "question": "How is the cost of the price for animal feed unrelated to the poultry cost for consumers?", "id": "5a860b8fb4e223001a8e73f9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "What is the major danger of chickens to women in underdeveloped countries?", "id": "5a860b8fb4e223001a8e73fa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Worldwide, more chickens are kept than any other type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs.
