The traditional 3rd - person pronoun t\u0101 ( \u4ed6 \" he , she , it \" ) , which is written with the \" person radical \" , illustrates modifying significs to form new characters . In modern usage , there is a graphic distinction between t\u0101 ( \u5979 \" she \" ) with the \" woman radical \" , t\u0101 ( \u7260 \" it \" ) with the \" animal radical \" , t\u0101 ( \u5b83 \" it \" ) with the \" roof radical \" , and t\u0101 ( \u7942 \" He \" ) with the \" deity radical \" , One consequence of modifying radicals is the fossilization of rare and obscure variant logographs , some of which are not even used in Classical Chinese . For instance , he \u548c \" harmony , peace \" , which combines the \" grain radical \" with the \" mouth radical \" , has infrequent variants \u548a with the radicals reversed and \u9fa2 with the \" flute radical \" .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does not include characters in the Chinese family?", "id": "5726e0b8f1498d1400e8ee5c", "answers": [{"text": "Zhonghua Zihai", "answer_start": 9}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is formed by Chinese principles?

Around the 13th century the N\u00f4m script was developed to record folk literature in the Vietnamese language . The script used Chinese characters to represent both borrowed Sino - Vietnamese vocabulary and native words with similar pronunciation or meaning . In addition thousands of new compound characters were created to write Vietnamese words . This process resulted in a highly complex system that was never mastered by more than 5 % of the population . Both Literary Chinese and N\u00f4m were replaced in the early 20th century by Vietnamese written with the Latin - based Vietnamese alphabet .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "When did the second ruler of North Korea pass away?", "id": "5726ec71708984140094d635", "answers": [{"text": "December 2011", "answer_start": 60}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who stepped up after 2011?", "id": "5726ec71708984140094d636", "answers": [{"text": "Kim Jong Un", "answer_start": 75}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who began moderating the use of Hanja?", "id": "5726ec71708984140094d637", "answers": [{"text": "Kim Jong Un", "answer_start": 75}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "After Kim Jong Il, the second ruler of North Korea, died in December 2011, Kim Jong Un stepped up and began mandating the use of Hanja as a source of definition for the Korean language.
