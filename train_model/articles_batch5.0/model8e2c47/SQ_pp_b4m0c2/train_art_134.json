Art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between \u2013 such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist . This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy , and whether it has been altered by over - enthusiastic restoration work . In general , the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version . It also gives useful insights into working practices .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who discovered infrared radiation?", "id": "570b92846b8089140040f99a", "answers": [{"text": "William Herschel", "answer_start": 51}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Herschel publish his work on infrared radiation?", "id": "570b92846b8089140040f99b", "answers": [{"text": "1800", "answer_start": 146}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "To whom did Herschel present his work on infrared radiation?", "id": "570b92846b8089140040f99c", "answers": [{"text": "the Royal Society of London", "answer_start": 158}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What device did Herschel use to discover the infrared?", "id": "570b92846b8089140040f99d", "answers": [{"text": "a prism", "answer_start": 201}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Herschel call the infrared spectrum?", "id": "570b92846b8089140040f99e", "answers": [{"text": "Calorific Rays", "answer_start": 417}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "William Herschel", "answer_start": 51}], "question": "Who discovered spectrum radiation?", "id": "5a0809c63fc874001820712f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "late in the 19th century", "answer_start": 475}], "question": "When did the term Calorific Rays start to be used?", "id": "5a0809c63fc8740018207130", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a prism", "answer_start": 201}], "question": "What did Herschel use to detect light from the sun?", "id": "5a0809c63fc8740018207131", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "light", "answer_start": 220}], "question": "What did Herschel refract from Calorific Rays?", "id": "5a0809c63fc8740018207132", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Royal Society of London", "answer_start": 158}], "question": "What society did Herschel present his work on the red spectrum?", "id": "5a0809c63fc8740018207133", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel, the astronomer, in the early 19th century.
