While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms , molecular phylogenetics , which uses DNA sequences as data , has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so . The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy . It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature . The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICN ) and administered by the International Botanical Congress .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the main grouping of a plant know as?", "id": "57278a735951b619008f8cd1", "answers": [{"text": "Kingdom", "answer_start": 132}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the most narrow grouping of a plant?", "id": "57278a735951b619008f8cd2", "answers": [{"text": "Species", "answer_start": 208}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Do different countries refer to plants by different names?", "id": "57278a735951b619008f8cd3", "answers": [{"text": "single world-wide name", "answer_start": 318}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What part of the name is always capitalized?", "id": "57278a735951b619008f8cd4", "answers": [{"text": "the genus", "answer_start": 610}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is the entire name usually presented in scientific texts?", "id": "57278a735951b619008f8cd5", "answers": [{"text": "italicised", "answer_start": 714}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Kingdom Plantae belongs to Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified.
