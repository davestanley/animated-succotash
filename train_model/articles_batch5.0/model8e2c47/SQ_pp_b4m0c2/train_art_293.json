The full symmetry group of Minkowski space , i.e. including translations , is known as the Poincar\u00e9 group . By the above , it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and , by implication , for quantum field theories . Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What product is created if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated?", "id": "57283f6d2ca10214002da17a", "answers": [{"text": "monoid", "answer_start": 233}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of numbers under addition form a monoid?", "id": "57283f6d2ca10214002da17b", "answers": [{"text": "natural numbers N (including 0)", "answer_start": 245}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What method formally adds inverses to elements to any monoid?", "id": "57283f6d2ca10214002da17c", "answers": [{"text": "the Grothendieck group", "answer_start": 541}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What can be replaced to simplify abstract algebra concepts?", "id": "57283f6d2ca10214002da17d", "answers": [{"text": "the binary operation", "answer_start": 896}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "more general structures", "answer_start": 21}], "question": "Axioms are defined by relaxing what?", "id": "5a81ff7e31013a001a33508d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "monoid", "answer_start": 233}], "question": "What is the inverse of every element called?", "id": "5a81ff7e31013a001a33508e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "(Z \u2216 {0}, \u00b7)", "answer_start": 518}], "question": "What is derived from (Q \\ [0],-)?", "id": "5a81ff7e31013a001a33508f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "composition a \u2022 b", "answer_start": 613}], "question": "What needs to be defined in Groupoids for a and b?", "id": "5a81ff7e31013a001a335090", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "group axioms", "answer_start": 1023}], "question": "What does generalizing an n-ary group give rise to?", "id": "5a81ff7e31013a001a335091", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In abstract algebra, more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group.
