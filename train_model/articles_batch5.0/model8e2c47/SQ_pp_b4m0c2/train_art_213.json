Although lossless video compression codecs perform at a compression factor of 5 - 12 , a typical MPEG-4 lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200 . As in all lossy compression , there is a trade - off between video quality , cost of processing the compression and decompression , and system requirements .
