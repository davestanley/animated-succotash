Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three-valued color quantum number that solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.", "allenNER": {"words": "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime , Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces . Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model . The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell - Mann . The relationship between the two models was murky ; Gell - Mann referred to Feynman 's partons derisively as \" put - ons \" . In the mid-1960s , physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers , not real particles , as the statistics of the Omega - minus particle , if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together , seemed impossible if quarks were real . The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed , analogously to Ernest Rutherford 's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911 , that nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) contained point - like particles that scattered electrons . It was natural to identify these with quarks , but Feynman 's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses . For example , the data showed that some 45 % of the energy momentum was carried by electrically - neutral particles in the nucleon . These electrically - neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks and carry also the three - valued color quantum number that solves the Omega - minus problem .

Shortly before his death , Feynman criticized string theory in an interview : \" I do n't like that they 're not calculating anything , \" he said . \" I do n't like that they do n't check their ideas . I do n't like that for anything that disagrees with an experiment , they cook up an explanation \u2014 a fix - up to say , ' Well , it still might be true .

Out of his enthusiastic interest in reaching Tuva came the phrase \" Tuva or Bust \" ( also the title of a book about his efforts to get there ) , which was tossed about frequently amongst his circle of friends in hope that they , one day , could see it firsthand . The documentary movie , Genghis Blues , mentions some of his attempts to communicate with Tuva and chronicles the successful journey there by his friends .
