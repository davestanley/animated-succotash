A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys , including The Great Appalachian Valley , which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions , but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features , and separates them from the Adirondack group . The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes , but in every portion the summits rise to rather uniform heights , and , especially in the central section , the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself . None of the summits reaches the region of perpetual snow .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "How tall are the mountains in Newfoundland?", "id": "5729a0203f37b3190047851d", "answers": [{"text": "3,000 ft", "answer_start": 68}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How tall are the mountains in Nova Scotia?", "id": "5729a0203f37b3190047851e", "answers": [{"text": "vary from 1,000 to 2,700 ft", "answer_start": 273}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How tall are the mountains in Maine?", "id": "5729a0203f37b3190047851f", "answers": [{"text": "exceed 4,000 ft", "answer_start": 340}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How tall are the mountains in New Hampshire?", "id": "5729a0203f37b31900478520", "answers": [{"text": "many summits rise above 5,000 ft", "answer_start": 435}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1,000 to 2,700 ft (300 to 800 m)", "answer_start": 283}], "question": "How tall are the isolated peaks in Notre Dame?", "id": "5ace207b32bba1001ae49b4b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mount Katahdin", "answer_start": 377}], "question": "What is the name of the 5,267ft peak in Nova Scotia?", "id": "5ace207b32bba1001ae49b4c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Lincoln", "answer_start": 714}], "question": "What is the smallest summit in the New Hampshire range?", "id": "5ace207b32bba1001ae49b4d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "New Hampshire", "answer_start": 420}], "question": "What state are the Green Mountains located in?", "id": "5ace207b32bba1001ae49b4e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mount Katahdin", "answer_start": 377}], "question": "What is the name of the mountain range in Maine?", "id": "5ace207b32bba1001ae49b4f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Mountains of the Long Range in Newfoundland reach heights of nearly 3,000 ft (900 m).
