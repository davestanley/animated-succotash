On April 7 , 2008 , two days prior to the actual torch relay , three activists carrying Tibetan flags scaled the suspension cables of the Golden Gate Bridge to unfurl two banners , one saying \" One World , One Dream . Free Tibet \" , and the other , \" Free Tibet ' 08 \" . Among them was San Francisco resident Laurel Sutherlin , who spoke to the local TV station KPIX - CBS5 live from a cellphone , urging the International Olympic Committee to ask China not to allow the torch to go through Tibet . \" Sutherlin said he was worried that the torch 's planned route through Tibet would lead to more arrests and Chinese officials would use force to stifle dissent . \" The three activists and five supporters face charges related to trespassing , conspiracy and causing a public nuisance .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where did the first relay runner disappear to with the torch??", "id": "56d8e895dc89441400fdb3c5", "answers": [{"text": "a warehouse", "answer_start": 250}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which wheelchair-bound torchbearer was ejected from the relay for showing a Tibetan flag?", "id": "56d8e895dc89441400fdb3c8", "answers": [{"text": "Andrew Michael", "answer_start": 1037}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What wheelchair-bound bearer of the Olympic torch displayed a Tibetan flag?", "id": "56db2747e7c41114004b4e31", "answers": [{"text": "Andrew Michael", "answer_start": 1037}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was the last part of the San Francisco torch relay carried through before getting on a bus?", "id": "56db2747e7c41114004b4e32", "answers": [{"text": "Marina district", "answer_start": 1515}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was a makeshift closing ceremony held for the torch relay in San Francisco?", "id": "56db2747e7c41114004b4e33", "answers": [{"text": "San Francisco International Airport", "answer_start": 1560}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "After the bearer of the torch disappeared into a warehouse, what road did the relay reappear on?", "id": "56db2747e7c41114004b4e34", "answers": [{"text": "Van Ness Avenue", "answer_start": 708}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The torch was lit at a park outside at AT&T Park at about 1:17 pm PDT (20:17 UTC), briefly held aloft by American and Chinese Olympic officials.
