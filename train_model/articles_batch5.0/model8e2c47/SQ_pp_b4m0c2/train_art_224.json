In 2004 an act of the Norfolk Island Assembly made it a co - official language of the island . The act is long - titled : \" An Act to recognise the Norfolk Island Language ( Norf'k ) as an official language of Norfolk Island . \" The \" language known as ' Norf'k ' \" is described as the language \" that is spoken by descendants of the first free settlers of Norfolk Island who were descendants of the settlers of Pitcairn Island \" . The act recognises and protects use of the language but does not require it ; in official use , it must be accompanied by an accurate translation into English . 32 % of the total population reported speaking a language other than English in the 2011 census , and just under three - quarters of the ordinarily resident population could speak Norfuk .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the only non-mainland Australian territory that is governed by itself?", "id": "5726b36add62a815002e8d54", "answers": [{"text": "Norfolk Island", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the Act that formerly governed Norfolk Island?", "id": "5726b36add62a815002e8d55", "answers": [{"text": "The Norfolk Island Act 1979", "answer_start": 95}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the new Act that governs Norfolk Island, passed in 2015?", "id": "5726b36add62a815002e8d56", "answers": [{"text": "the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015", "answer_start": 239}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who is the current administrator of Norfolk Island?", "id": "5726b36add62a815002e8d57", "answers": [{"text": "Gary Hardgrave", "answer_start": 386}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "During 1979-2015, Legislative Assembly terms lasted no longer than how many years?", "id": "5726b36add62a815002e8d58", "answers": [{"text": "three years", "answer_start": 499}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Norfolk Island", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is one of only two non-mainland Australian territories that is governed by itself?", "id": "5a81bbfe31013a001a334e11", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Norfolk Island Act 1979", "answer_start": 95}], "question": "What is the name of the Act that will govern Norfolk Island?", "id": "5a81bbfe31013a001a334e12", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015", "answer_start": 239}], "question": "What is the name of the new Act that governs Norfolk Island, passed in 2016?", "id": "5a81bbfe31013a001a334e13", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gary Hardgrave", "answer_start": 386}], "question": "Who is the future administrator of Norfolk Island?", "id": "5a81bbfe31013a001a334e14", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Norfolk Island is the only non-mainland Australian territory to have achieved self-governance.
