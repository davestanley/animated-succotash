Although Descartes agreed with the contemporary position , that a vacuum does not occur in nature , the success of his namesake coordinate system and more implicitly , the spatial \u2013 corporeal component of his metaphysics would come to define the philosophically modern notion of empty space as a quantified extension of volume . By the ancient definition however , directional information and magnitude were conceptually distinct . With the acquiescence of Cartesian mechanical philosophy to the \" brute fact \" of action at a distance , and at length , its successful reification by force fields and ever more sophisticated geometric structure , the anachronism of empty space widened until \" a seething ferment \" of quantum activity in the 20th century filled the vacuum with a virtual pleroma .", "tags": "0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "An infinite sea of particles with negative energy  was a model propesed by whom?", "id": "572eac6adfa6aa1500f8d295", "answers": [{"text": "Paul Dirac", "answer_start": 9}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year was the Dirac sea modeled?", "id": "572eac6adfa6aa1500f8d296", "answers": [{"text": "1930", "answer_start": 3}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When werer virtual particles confirmed?", "id": "572eac6adfa6aa1500f8d297", "answers": [{"text": "late 20th century", "answer_start": 567}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year was the uncertainty principle formed?", "id": "572eac6adfa6aa1500f8d298", "answers": [{"text": "1927,", "answer_start": 358}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What theorized that time and energy can be measured?", "id": "572eac6adfa6aa1500f8d299", "answers": [{"text": "Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle", "answer_start": 302}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "negative", "answer_start": 94}], "question": "What kind of energy did Werner Heisenberg believe a vacuum held?", "id": "5a8783441d3cee001a6a1206", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Dirac sea", "answer_start": 118}], "question": "What did Heisenberg call the particles with negative energy inside a vacuum?", "id": "5a8783441d3cee001a6a1207", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the positron", "answer_start": 261}], "question": "What did Heisenberg predict the existence of in 1930?", "id": "5a8783441d3cee001a6a1208", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "two years", "answer_start": 285}], "question": "How long did it take for the uncertainty principle by Dirac to be confirmed?", "id": "5a8783441d3cee001a6a1209", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "energy and time", "answer_start": 445}], "question": "What in the late 20th century did Dirac theorize can be measured?", "id": "5a8783441d3cee001a6a120a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In 1930, Paul Dirac proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy, called the Dirac sea.

All materials , solid or liquid , have a small vapour pressure , and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure . In man - made systems , outgassing has the same effect as a leak and can limit the achievable vacuum . Outgassing products may condense on nearby colder surfaces , which can be troublesome if they obscure optical instruments or react with other materials . This is of great concern to space missions , where an obscured telescope or solar cell can ruin an expensive mission .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Repeatedly closing off a compartment of a vacuum allows what?", "id": "572ed67403f9891900756a71", "answers": [{"text": "continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth", "answer_start": 3}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is a vacuum created inside of a manual water pump?", "id": "572ed67403f9891900756a72", "answers": [{"text": "a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity", "answer_start": 285}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why is fluid in a manual pump pushed into the pumps cavity when a small sealed cavity is expanded?", "id": "572ed67403f9891900756a73", "answers": [{"text": "Because of the pressure differential", "answer_start": 347}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are pumps based off principle of sealed compartment pulling,pushing and expanding called?", "id": "572ed67403f9891900756a74", "answers": [{"text": "displacement pumps", "answer_start": 208}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth", "answer_start": 3}], "question": "What does repeatedly putting water into the atmosphere manually allow?", "id": "5a87c70d19b91f001a626db1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity", "answer_start": 285}], "question": "How is a vacuum created in the atmosphere?", "id": "5a87c70d19b91f001a626db2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "infinite", "answer_start": 64}], "question": "What kind of growth happens when fluid enters the atmosphere?", "id": "5a87c70d19b91f001a626db3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a small sealed cavity", "answer_start": 305}], "question": "What expands outside the pump?", "id": "5a87c70d19b91f001a626db4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a minute size", "answer_start": 581}], "question": "What size is the vacuum in the pump?", "id": "5a87c70d19b91f001a626db5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "To continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth, a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off, exhausted, and expanded again.
