Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant . Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses . Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain . Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk . Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency ( PMRA ) of Canada .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What kind of pesticide is DDT?", "id": "572690b9f1498d1400e8e3f8", "answers": [{"text": "an organochlorine", "answer_start": 40}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why have DDTs been banned in some areas?", "id": "572690b9f1498d1400e8e3f9", "answers": [{"text": "persistence in the environment and human toxicity", "answer_start": 326}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Is DDT 100% guaranteed to work?", "id": "572690b9f1498d1400e8e3fa", "answers": [{"text": "DDT use is not always effective", "answer_start": 377}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How may species have been found to be resistant to DDT?", "id": "572690b9f1498d1400e8e3fb", "answers": [{"text": "nineteen", "answer_start": 486}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1972", "answer_start": 481}], "question": "When were 19 new species of mosquito discovered in Africa?", "id": "5a70f1fd0efcfe001a8afce1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "since the 1950s", "answer_start": 94}], "question": "How long has DDT been banned worldwide?", "id": "5a70f1fd0efcfe001a8afce2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "have given stronger support to this approach", "answer_start": 169}], "question": "How supportive is Africa about DDT being banned?", "id": "5a70f1fd0efcfe001a8afce3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1955", "answer_start": 468}], "question": "In what year was DDT first invented?", "id": "5a70f1fd0efcfe001a8afce4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1972", "answer_start": 481}], "question": "When were mosquitoes first discovered to carry Malaria?", "id": "5a70f1fd0efcfe001a8afce5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "DDT, sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochlorine that has been used to fight malaria since the 1950s.
