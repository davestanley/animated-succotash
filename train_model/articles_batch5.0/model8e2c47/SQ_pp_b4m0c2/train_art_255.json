In some years , several hurricanes or tropical storms can directly strike the state or brush across the coastal areas . Only Florida and Louisiana are hit by hurricanes more often . Although many people believe that hurricanes menace only coastal areas , the rare hurricane which moves inland quickly enough can cause severe damage ; for example , in 1989 , Hurricane Hugo caused heavy damage in Charlotte and even as far inland as the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northwestern part of the state . On the average , North Carolina has 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year , with some storms becoming severe enough to produce hail , flash floods , and damaging winds .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "How many tornadoes does North Carolina have per year?", "id": "57276d2ff1498d1400e8f7d6", "answers": [{"text": "fewer than 20", "answer_start": 24}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Houuricanes and tropical stors can produce what across the coastal plain?", "id": "57276d2ff1498d1400e8f7d7", "answers": [{"text": "tornadoes", "answer_start": 38}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What part of the state holds the highest risk for tornadoes?", "id": "57276d2ff1498d1400e8f7d8", "answers": [{"text": "eastern", "answer_start": 197}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What protects the western piedmont from tornadoes?", "id": "57276d2ff1498d1400e8f7d9", "answers": [{"text": "mountains", "answer_start": 271}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What weather phenomenom can weaken storms but cause major ice events in NW North Carolina?", "id": "57276d2ff1498d1400e8f7da", "answers": [{"text": "cold air damming", "answer_start": 419}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "North Carolina averages fewer than 20 tornadoes per year, many of them produced by hurricanes or tropical storms along the coastal plain.
