Waterclocks , and later , mechanical clocks , were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages . Richard of Wallingford ( 1292\u20131336 ) , abbot of St. Alban 's abbey , famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical orrery about 1330 . Great advances in accurate time - keeping were made by Galileo Galilei and especially Christiaan Huygens with the invention of pendulum driven clocks along with the invention of the minute hand by Jost Burgi .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which timekeeping devices are the most accurate?", "id": "5727fdb7ff5b5019007d9a56", "answers": [{"text": "atomic clocks", "answer_start": 42}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What method do atomic clocks use to measure seconds?", "id": "5727fdb7ff5b5019007d9a57", "answers": [{"text": "the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms", "answer_start": 200}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which system bases its unit of time on the properties of caesium?", "id": "5727fdb7ff5b5019007d9a58", "answers": [{"text": "the International System of Measurements", "answer_start": 451}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How long has the International System of Measurements based the second on caesium?", "id": "5727fdb7ff5b5019007d9a59", "answers": [{"text": "Since 1967", "answer_start": 439}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1967", "answer_start": 445}], "question": "In what year were caesium atoms discovered?", "id": "5a7df7ed70df9f001a87537b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "timekeeping", "answer_start": 18}], "question": "What are microwaves the most accurate at doing?", "id": "5a7df7ed70df9f001a87537c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "other clocks and timekeeping instruments", "answer_start": 140}], "question": "What are microwaves also used to calibrate?", "id": "5a7df7ed70df9f001a87537d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "International System of Measurements", "answer_start": 455}], "question": "What system bases its unit of time on microwave properties?", "id": "5a7df7ed70df9f001a87537e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "9,192,631,770 cycles", "answer_start": 589}], "question": "How many cycles of radiation are in microwaves?", "id": "5a7df7ed70df9f001a87537f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "atomic clocks", "answer_start": 42}], "question": "Which timekeeping devices are the least accurate?", "id": "5a80e55f8f0597001ac001f7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms", "answer_start": 200}], "question": "What method do atomic clocks use to measure cycles?", "id": "5a80e55f8f0597001ac001f8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the International System of Measurements", "answer_start": 451}], "question": "Which system bases its unit of time on the properties of vibrations?", "id": "5a80e55f8f0597001ac001f9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Since 1967", "answer_start": 439}], "question": "How long has the International System of Measurements based the second on years?", "id": "5a80e55f8f0597001ac001fa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom", "answer_start": 586}], "question": "How does caesium deine the second?", "id": "5a80e55f8f0597001ac001fb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years, and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.

According to the special theory of relativity , in the high - speed particle 's frame of reference , it exists , on the average , for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime , and the distance it travels in that time is zero , because its velocity is zero . Relative to a frame of reference at rest , time seems to \" slow down \" for the particle . Relative to the high - speed particle , distances seem to shorten .
