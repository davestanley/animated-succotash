A few nouns exist solely in a diminutive form , e.g. zeepaardje ( seahorse ) , while many , e.g. meisje ( girl ) , originally a diminutive of meid ( maid ) , have acquired a meaning independent of their non - diminutive forms . A diminutive can sometimes be added to an uncountable noun to refer to a single portion : ijs ( ice , ice cream ) \u2192 ijsje ( ice cream treat , cone of ice cream ) , bier ( beer ) \u2192 biertje . Some diminutive forms only exist in plural , e.g. kleertjes ( clothing ) .", "tags": "0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What language besides Dutch uses the dative case instead of the accusative for pronouns?", "id": "57268f9cf1498d1400e8e3d2", "answers": [{"text": "English", "answer_start": 8}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In the lone exception to the dative case, which pronoun is prescribed for the third person plural direct object?", "id": "57268f9cf1498d1400e8e3d3", "answers": [{"text": "hen", "answer_start": 240}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the grammarians first draw the line between third person plural pronouns for Dutch?", "id": "57268f9cf1498d1400e8e3d4", "answers": [{"text": "17th century", "answer_start": 366}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Since most Dutch speakers don't bother with the hen/hun rule, which of the two most often gets used?", "id": "57268f9cf1498d1400e8e3d5", "answers": [{"text": "hun", "answer_start": 578}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When speakers get confused about whether to use hen or hun, what interchangeable unstressed form would they probably use?", "id": "57268f9cf1498d1400e8e3d6", "answers": [{"text": "ze", "answer_start": 628}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Like in English, Dutch has generalised the dative over the accusative case for all pronouns, e.g. Du me, je, Eng me, you, vs. Germ mich/mir dich/dir.
