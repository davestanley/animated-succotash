For example , certain processes in quantum mechanics , relating to the weak nuclear force , are not time - reversible , keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time - reversibility comprises a more complex definition . But this type of solution is insufficient because 1 ) the time - asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time - asymmetry and 2 ) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.[citation needed ]", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution?", "id": "572a36f06aef05140015538a", "answers": [{"text": "Tim Maudlin", "answer_start": 45}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Maudlin argues that the passage of time is what kind of asymmetry?", "id": "572a36f06aef05140015538b", "answers": [{"text": "intrinsic", "answer_start": 216}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What grounds the distinction between sequences?", "id": "572a36f06aef05140015538c", "answers": [{"text": "asymmetry", "answer_start": 226}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Whose suggestion is difficult to assess in regards to the direction of time?", "id": "572a36f06aef05140015538d", "answers": [{"text": "Maudlin", "answer_start": 498}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Tim Maudlin", "answer_start": 45}], "question": "Who oposses the laws solution?", "id": "5a42d1c04a4859001aac7343", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Tim Maudlin", "answer_start": 45}], "question": "Who says that the laws of physics are not laws of temporal evolution?", "id": "5a42d1c04a4859001aac7344", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "an intrinsic asymmetry", "answer_start": 213}], "question": "What does Maudlin claim time is not in the structure of the world?", "id": "5a42d1c04a4859001aac7345", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past", "answer_start": 311}], "question": "What does the symetry in the temoral structure of the world ground?", "id": "5a42d1c04a4859001aac7346", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "One recent proponent of the laws solution is Tim Maudlin who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin ).
