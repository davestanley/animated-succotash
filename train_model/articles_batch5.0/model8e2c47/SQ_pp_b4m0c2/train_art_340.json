Their contemporary , Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452\u20131519 ) said , \" If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down , then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings . \"", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "When was Vincenzo Galilei born?", "id": "572b345c111d821400f38dc8", "answers": [{"text": "ca. 1520", "answer_start": 83}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Vincenzo Galilei die?", "id": "572b345c111d821400f38dc9", "answers": [{"text": "1591", "answer_start": 92}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was Vincenzo Galilei's oldest son?", "id": "572b345c111d821400f38dca", "answers": [{"text": "Galileo", "answer_start": 109}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does 'esperienza' mean?", "id": "572b345c111d821400f38dcb", "answers": [{"text": "experiment", "answer_start": 519}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1520", "answer_start": 87}], "question": "When was Galileo born?", "id": "5a57c040770dc0001aeefd48", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1591", "answer_start": 92}], "question": "When did Galileo die?", "id": "5a57c040770dc0001aeefd49", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Coelho", "answer_start": 651}], "question": "Who wrote Music and Science in the age of Galileo?", "id": "5a57c040770dc0001aeefd4a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1581", "answer_start": 482}], "question": "When did Vincenzo discover the meaning of Pythagoras' hammers'?", "id": "5a57c040770dc0001aeefd4b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Florence", "answer_start": 472}], "question": "Where was Galileo born?", "id": "5a57c040770dc0001aeefd4c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist Vincenzo Galilei (ca. 1520\u20131591), father of Galileo and the inventor of monody, made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his Dialogo della musica antica e moderna (Florence, 1581).

Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation . There is , however , no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer . According to phenomenalism , to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer , the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal . But , of course , the doctor himself must be a normal observer . If we are to specify this doctor 's normality in sensory terms , we must make reference to a second doctor who , when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor , would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer . And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer , we must refer to a third doctor , and so on ( also see the third man ) .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What are other terms for logical empiricism?", "id": "572b415834ae481900dead4f", "answers": [{"text": "logical positivism or neopositivism", "answer_start": 25}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was logical empricism formulated?", "id": "572b415834ae481900dead50", "answers": [{"text": "early 20th-century", "answer_start": 69}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did logical empiricism try to combine with mathematical logic?", "id": "572b415834ae481900dead51", "answers": [{"text": "British empiricism", "answer_start": 133}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was Otto Neurath an important member of?", "id": "572b415834ae481900dead52", "answers": [{"text": "Logical empiricism", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was AJ Ayer an important member of?", "id": "572b415834ae481900dead53", "answers": [{"text": "Logical empiricism", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "early 20th-century", "answer_start": 69}], "question": "When were Gottlob Frege's mathematical insights published?", "id": "5a57da08770dc0001aeefe0e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Vienna Circle", "answer_start": 429}], "question": "Who named neopositivism?", "id": "5a57da08770dc0001aeefe0f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Vienna Circle", "answer_start": 429}], "question": "What was Ludwig Wittgenstein part of?", "id": "5a57da08770dc0001aeefe10", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "British", "answer_start": 133}], "question": "What was Ludwig Wittgenstein's nationality?", "id": "5a57da08770dc0001aeefe11", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Otto Neurath, Moritz Schlick", "answer_start": 384}], "question": "Who founded the Vienna Circle?", "id": "5a57da08770dc0001aeefe12", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Logical empiricism (also logical positivism or neopositivism) was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from mathematical logic that had been developed by Gottlob Frege and Ludwig Wittgenstein.
