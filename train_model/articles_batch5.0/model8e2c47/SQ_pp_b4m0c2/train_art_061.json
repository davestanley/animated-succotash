Many publications credit DST 's proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett , who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre - breakfast ride , when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer 's day . An avid golfer , he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk . His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months , a proposal he published two years later . The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament ( MP ) Robert Pearce , who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on 12 February 1908 . A select committee was set up to examine the issue , but Pearce 's bill did not become law , and several other bills failed in the following years . Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915 .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What year did Germany decide to try DST?", "id": "56e7299137bdd419002c3ddb", "answers": [{"text": "1916", "answer_start": 21}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the German word for Daylight Saving Time?", "id": "56e7299137bdd419002c3ddc", "answers": [{"text": "Sommerzeit", "answer_start": 111}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What natural resource were Germany and Austria-Hungary trying to conserve by using DST?", "id": "56e7299137bdd419002c3ddd", "answers": [{"text": "coal", "answer_start": 144}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year did the United States get on board with DST?", "id": "56e7299137bdd419002c3dde", "answers": [{"text": "1918", "answer_start": 337}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Starting on 30 April 1916, Germany and its World War I ally Austria-Hungary were the first to use DST (German: Sommerzeit) as a way to conserve coal during wartime.

In Windows 98 , Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST , forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year . The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules ' dates in a year - independent way . Partial workarounds , which mishandled older time stamps , included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically . In 2013 , Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does Microsoft Windows use internally for its real-time clock?", "id": "56e7a89837bdd419002c42dc", "answers": [{"text": "local time", "answer_start": 54}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Not using UTC, Windows can't multi boot with different versions of itself like you'd need to do to use what kind of disk?", "id": "56e7a89837bdd419002c42dd", "answers": [{"text": "a rescue boot disk", "answer_start": 280}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "As opposed to providing support for users to have unique time zone settings, Windows will only allow for what?", "id": "56e7a89837bdd419002c42de", "answers": [{"text": "a single system-wide setting", "answer_start": 414}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Microsoft imply that they would be making changes to support RealTimeIsUniversal in a step towards compatibility with UTC?", "id": "56e7a89837bdd419002c42df", "answers": [{"text": "2008", "answer_start": 447}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Since 2008, at least how many times has Microsoft released fixes for the RealTimeIsUniversal feature?", "id": "56e7a89837bdd419002c42e0", "answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 720}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Microsoft Windows keeps the system real-time clock in local time.
