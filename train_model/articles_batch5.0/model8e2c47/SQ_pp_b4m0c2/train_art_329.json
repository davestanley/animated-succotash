There were , however , other common genres , most particularly the mesnev\u00ee , a kind of verse romance and thus a variety of narrative poetry ; the two most notable examples of this form are the Leyli and Majnun of Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee and the H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk of \u015eeyh G\u00e2lib .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Prose in the Ottoman empire did not develop to a higher level until which century?", "id": "572a5abcd562191400bc8697", "answers": [{"text": "the 19th century", "answer_start": 6}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What rules did Ottoman prose have to follow?", "id": "572a5abcd562191400bc8698", "answers": [{"text": "the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or rhymed prose", "answer_start": 186}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the rules of sec require?", "id": "572a5abcd562191400bc8699", "answers": [{"text": "between each adjective and noun in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a rhyme", "answer_start": 331}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who wrote Muhayyel\u00e2t?", "id": "572a5abcd562191400bc869a", "answers": [{"text": "Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi", "answer_start": 601}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was Muhayyel\u00e2t written?", "id": "572a5abcd562191400bc869b", "answers": [{"text": "1796", "answer_start": 678}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did.
