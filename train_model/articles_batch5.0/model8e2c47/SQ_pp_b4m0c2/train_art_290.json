At the beginning of the 20th century , efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell 's paradox ( on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves ) . The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel . Zermelo \u2013 Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics . But they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself . In his doctoral thesis of 1925 , von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets \u2014 the axiom of foundation and the notion of class .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the method to demonstrate that no contradictions were created by the addition of axiom of foundation?", "id": "572818a43acd2414000df465", "answers": [{"text": "method of inner models", "answer_start": 519}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Zermelo and Fraenkel's axiom of foundation established that every set be constructed how?", "id": "572818a43acd2414000df466", "answers": [{"text": "from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps", "answer_start": 70}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What excluded a set from belonging to itself in set theory?", "id": "572818a43acd2414000df467", "answers": [{"text": "if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession", "answer_start": 195}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The axiom of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel, in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession, hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself.

Donald Knuth cites von Neumann as the inventor , in 1945 , of the merge sort algorithm , in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged . Von Neumann wrote the sorting program for the EDVAC in ink , being 23 pages long ; traces can still be seen on the first page of the phrase \" TOP SECRET \" , which was written in pencil and later erased . He also worked on the philosophy of artificial intelligence with Alan Turing when the latter visited Princeton in the 1930s .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where were the computations for hydrogen bomb worked out?", "id": "5728489dff5b5019007da0d8", "answers": [{"text": "von Neumann's digital computers", "answer_start": 128}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the Monte Carlo method?", "id": "5728489dff5b5019007da0d9", "answers": [{"text": "allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers", "answer_start": 279}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Due to slow use of random numbers what was developed?", "id": "5728489dff5b5019007da0da", "answers": [{"text": "pseudorandom numbers", "answer_start": 612}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Von Neumann's hydrogen bomb work was played out in the realm of computing, where he and Stanislaw Ulam developed simulations on von Neumann's digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations.

As far as I could tell , von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim ; moreover , he could do it years later without hesitation . He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English . On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how A Tale of Two Cities started . Whereupon , without any pause , he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes . \" Ulam noted that von Neumann 's way of thinking might not be visual , but more of an aural one .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe think of von NEumann's ability?", "id": "57285159ff5b5019007da170", "answers": [{"text": "I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's does not indicate a species superior to that of man", "answer_start": 1}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did James Glimm have to say about von Nuemann?", "id": "57285159ff5b5019007da171", "answers": [{"text": "he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics", "answer_start": 459}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What description did Peter Lax use for von Neumann?", "id": "57285159ff5b5019007da172", "answers": [{"text": "most scintillating intellect of this century", "answer_start": 660}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "\"I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's does not indicate a species superior to that of man\", said Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe of Cornell University. \"It seems fair to say that if the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived,\" wrote Mikl\u00f3s R\u00e9dei in \"Selected Letters.\" James Glimm wrote: \"he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics\".
