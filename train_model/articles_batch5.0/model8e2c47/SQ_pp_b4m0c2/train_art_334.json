Medreses were built in as part of a Mosque complex where many programmes , such as aid to the poor through soup kitchens , were held under the infrastructure of a mosque , which reveals the interconnectedness of religion and social life during this period . \" The mosques to which medreses were attached , dominated the social life in Ottoman cities . \" Social life was not dominated by religion only in the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire ; it was also quite similar to the social life of Europe during this period . As Goffman says : \" Just as mosques dominated social life for the Ottomans , churches and synagogues dominated life for the Christians and Jews as well . \" Hence , social life and the medrese were closely linked , since medreses taught many curricula , such as religion , which highly governed social life in terms of establishing orthodoxy . \" They tried moving their developing state toward Islamic orthodoxy . \" Overall , the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy . Hence , medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What group makes up a larger percentage of people in India?", "id": "572a8990f75d5e190021fb56", "answers": [{"text": "Deobandis", "answer_start": 180}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the largest school for Barelvis people in India?", "id": "572a8990f75d5e190021fb57", "answers": [{"text": "Jamia Nayeemia Muradabad", "answer_start": 480}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What disciplines does India want to introduce to madaris?", "id": "572a8990f75d5e190021fb58", "answers": [{"text": "Mathematics, Computers and science", "answer_start": 846}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did the Indian government begin to stop recognizing madaris as schools?", "id": "572a8990f75d5e190021fb59", "answers": [{"text": "2015", "answer_start": 908}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What problems are arising due to the political conflicts over schools?", "id": "572a8990f75d5e190021fb5a", "answers": [{"text": "Hindu-Muslim friction", "answer_start": 1098}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Deobandis", "answer_start": 180}], "question": " What group makes up a smaller percentage of people in India?", "id": "5ace820b32bba1001ae4a8cb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jamia Nayeemia Muradabad", "answer_start": 480}], "question": " What is the smallest school for Barelvis people outside of India?", "id": "5ace820b32bba1001ae4a8cc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mathematics, Computers and science", "answer_start": 846}], "question": " What disciplines does India want to keep away from madaris?", "id": "5ace820b32bba1001ae4a8cd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2015", "answer_start": 908}], "question": "In what year did the Indian government begin recognize madaris as schools?", "id": "5ace820b32bba1001ae4a8ce", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Hindu-Muslim friction", "answer_start": 1098}], "question": "What problems are not arising due to the social conflicts over schools?", "id": "5ace820b32bba1001ae4a8cf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In India the majority of these schools follow the Hanafi school of thought.
