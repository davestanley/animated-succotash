Burke wrote on 29 November 1790 : \" I have received from the Duke of Portland , Lord Fitzwilliam , the Duke of Devonshire , Lord John Cavendish , Montagu ( Frederick Montagu MP ) , and a long et cetera of the old Stamina of the Whiggs a most full approbation of the principles of that work and a kind indulgence to the execution \" . The Duke of Portland said in 1791 that when anyone criticised the Reflections to him , he informed them that he had recommended the book to his sons as containing the true Whig creed .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who wrote 'The Rights of Man'?", "id": "5726adef5951b619008f7a01", "answers": [{"text": "Thomas Paine", "answer_start": 44}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who wrote 'A Vindication of the Rights of Men'?", "id": "5726adef5951b619008f7a02", "answers": [{"text": "Mary Wollstonecraft", "answer_start": 114}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who said the Reflections were \"the manifesto of a Counter Revolution\"?", "id": "5726adef5951b619008f7a03", "answers": [{"text": "James Mackintosh", "answer_start": 183}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Mackintosh compare Burke to?", "id": "5726adef5951b619008f7a04", "answers": [{"text": "Lord Bacon and Cicero", "answer_start": 712}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What types of wisdom did Mackintosh say Burke had?", "id": "5726adef5951b619008f7a05", "answers": [{"text": "political and moral", "answer_start": 776}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1791", "answer_start": 85}], "question": "When did Mary Wollstonecraft publish her response?", "id": "5ad0d0e6645df0001a2d04ce", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "December 1796", "answer_start": 375}], "question": "When did Mary meet Burke?", "id": "5ad0d0e6645df0001a2d04cf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "political and moral wisdom", "answer_start": 776}], "question": "What did Mackintosh claim he had more of than any other writer?", "id": "5ad0d0e6645df0001a2d04d0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Lord Bacon and Cicero", "answer_start": 712}], "question": "Who did Thomas Paine compare Burke to?", "id": "5ad0d0e6645df0001a2d04d1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the manifesto of a Counter Revolution", "answer_start": 278}], "question": "What did Paine call Reflections?", "id": "5ad0d0e6645df0001a2d04d2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Burke's Reflections sparked a pamphlet war.
