Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down : mechanical and chemical digestion . The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes . In chemical digestion , enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What are three digestions phases?", "id": "570cf137b3d812140066d35d", "answers": [{"text": "the cephalic phase , gastric phase, and intestinal phase", "answer_start": 52}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where does the cephalic phase occur?", "id": "570cf137b3d812140066d35e", "answers": [{"text": "at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex", "answer_start": 136}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where are taste and smell stimuli sent to?", "id": "570cf137b3d812140066d35f", "answers": [{"text": "the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata", "answer_start": 250}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How long does the gastric phase take?", "id": "570cf137b3d812140066d360", "answers": [{"text": "3 to 4 hours", "answer_start": 642}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is the gastric phase stimulated to start?", "id": "570cf137b3d812140066d361", "answers": [{"text": "by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH", "answer_start": 673}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase , gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released.

Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed , and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches . The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes . Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract , and the process finishes with defecation .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where does protein digestion occur?", "id": "570cf4cefed7b91900d45b7b", "answers": [{"text": "in the stomach and duodenum", "answer_start": 25}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the three main enzymes that break down food?", "id": "570cf4cefed7b91900d45b7c", "answers": [{"text": "pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin", "answer_start": 78}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are digestive enzymes mostly secreted as?", "id": "570cf4cefed7b91900d45b7d", "answers": [{"text": "inactive precursors, the zymogens", "answer_start": 352}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are dipeptidases broken down into?", "id": "570cf4cefed7b91900d45b7e", "answers": [{"text": "amino acids", "answer_start": 280}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What organ secretes chymotrypsin?", "id": "570cf4cefed7b91900d45b7f", "answers": [{"text": "the pancreas", "answer_start": 150}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids.
