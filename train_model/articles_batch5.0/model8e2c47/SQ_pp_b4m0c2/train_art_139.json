The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then - chairman of the Economical - Statutory Committee , Jaime Gil - Aluja . The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non - profit sport company . In 2004 , a company could become one of 25 \" Honorary members \" by contributing between \u00a3 40,000\u201360,000 ( \u00a3 54,800\u201382,300 ) per year . There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of \u00a3 14,000 ( \u00a3 19,200 ) and an unlimited number of \" patronages \" for the cost of \u00a3 4,000 per year ( \u00a3 5,500 ) . It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy , but according to the author Anthony King , it is \" unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club \" .", "tags": "0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the game between the rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid called?", "id": "570c7a9afed7b91900d459e5", "answers": [{"text": "El Cl\u00e1sico", "answer_start": 193}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What basic difference is there between the teams of Barcelona and Real Madrid?", "id": "570c7a9afed7b91900d459e6", "answers": [{"text": "rival regions", "answer_start": 291}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What areas of Spain do the teams of Barcelona and Real Madrid represent?", "id": "570c7a9afed7b91900d459e7", "answers": [{"text": "Catalonia and Castile", "answer_start": 315}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of tensions are the two teams viewed as displaying?", "id": "570c7a9afed7b91900d459e8", "answers": [{"text": "political and cultural", "answer_start": 413}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Besides the areas of Spain, what other differences are there between Barcelona and Real Madrid?", "id": "570c7a9afed7b91900d459e9", "answers": [{"text": "two cities", "answer_start": 356}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Cl\u00e1sico.

His presidency was to last for 22 years , and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona , as N\u00fa\u00f1ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline , letting go of such players as Maradona , Rom\u00e1rio and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands .", "tags": "0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What team did favorite play Luis Figo leave Barcelona to join?", "id": "570c9615fed7b91900d45a03", "answers": [{"text": "Real Madrid", "answer_start": 292}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of treatment was Figo offered during visits to Barcelona?", "id": "570c9615fed7b91900d45a04", "answers": [{"text": "hostile", "answer_start": 380}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "After Figo's departure what happened the next three years?", "id": "570c9615fed7b91900d45a05", "answers": [{"text": "decline", "answer_start": 539}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What rank was club Barcelona in 2003?", "id": "570c9615fed7b91900d45a06", "answers": [{"text": "15th", "answer_start": 1415}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "After Barcelona's poor showing in the 2003 season , who resigned from the presidency?", "id": "570c9615fed7b91900d45a07", "answers": [{"text": "Joan Gaspart", "answer_start": 1689}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu\u00eds Figo, then club vice-captain.
