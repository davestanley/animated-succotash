Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase , which reads the template strand in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5 ' to 3 ' . To initiate transcription , the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene . Thus , a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region , either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase , or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.:7", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where does transcription occur in prokaryotes?", "id": "56f8bd719b226e1400dd0ef7", "answers": [{"text": "in the cytoplasm", "answer_start": 37}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "If the transcription is very long, where on the RNA may translation begin?", "id": "56f8bd719b226e1400dd0ef8", "answers": [{"text": "at the 5' end of the RNA", "answer_start": 104}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where does transcription occur in eukaryotes?", "id": "56f8bd719b226e1400dd0ef9", "answers": [{"text": "transcription occurs in the nucleus", "answer_start": 189}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where does a eukaryote store the cell's DNA?", "id": "56f8bd719b226e1400dd0efa", "answers": [{"text": "in the nucleus", "answer_start": 210}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the RNA molecule produced by the polymerase known as?", "id": "56f8bd719b226e1400dd0efb", "answers": [{"text": "the primary transcript", "answer_start": 314}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In prokaryotes, transcription occurs in the cytoplasm; for very long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5' end of the RNA while the 3' end is still being transcribed.

This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication.:5.2 The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA polymerases , which \" read \" one strand of the double - helical DNA , known as the template strand , and synthesize a new complementary strand . Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing , the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement ; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy . The process of DNA replication is semiconservative ; that is , the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of DNA.:5.2", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is one thing the cell must do once DNA replication is compete?", "id": "56f8cb819e9bad19000a0504", "answers": [{"text": "physically separate the two copies of the genome", "answer_start": 49}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is another thing the cell must do once DNA replication is complete?", "id": "56f8cb819e9bad19000a0505", "answers": [{"text": "divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells", "answer_start": 102}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In binary fission, what shape is each genome?", "id": "56f8cb819e9bad19000a0506", "answers": [{"text": "circular", "answer_start": 281}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In binary fission. when does each genome separate into daughter cells?", "id": "56f8cb819e9bad19000a0507", "answers": [{"text": "as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm", "answer_start": 368}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes, with what speed does binary fission occur?", "id": "56f8cb819e9bad19000a0508", "answers": [{"text": "extremely fast", "answer_start": 471}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "After DNA replication is complete, the cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells.:18.2 In prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions.

Since the 1970s , a variety of techniques have been developed to specifically add , remove and edit genes in an organism . Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired . The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has become a common research tool with model organisms?", "id": "56f8e37f9b226e1400dd1194", "answers": [{"text": "Genetic engineering", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do scientists explore by adding genes to mice with a certain gene's function disrupted?", "id": "56f8e37f9b226e1400dd1195", "answers": [{"text": "that gene's function", "answer_start": 217}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an application for which organisms have been modified for?", "id": "56f8e37f9b226e1400dd1196", "answers": [{"text": "agriculture", "answer_start": 305}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is another for which  organisms have been modified for?", "id": "56f8e37f9b226e1400dd1197", "answers": [{"text": "industrial biotechnology", "answer_start": 318}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is yet another application for which  organisms have been modified for?", "id": "56f8e37f9b226e1400dd1198", "answers": [{"text": "medicine", "answer_start": 348}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Genetic engineering is now a routine research tool with model organisms.
