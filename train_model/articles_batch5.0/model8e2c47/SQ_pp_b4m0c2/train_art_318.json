Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated . At the national level , at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 % of energy supply . Also , Professors S. Pacala and Robert H. Socolow have developed a series of \" stabilization wedges \" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change , and \" renewable energy sources , \" in aggregate , constitute the largest number of their \" wedges . \"", "tags": "0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University?", "id": "57297650af94a219006aa47b", "answers": [{"text": "Mark Z.
