Under Maeser 's direction the school educated many luminaries including future U.S. Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland and future U.S. Senator Reed Smoot among others . The school , however , did not become a university until the end of Benjamin Cluff , Jr 's term at the helm of the institution . At that time , the school was also still privately supported by members of the community and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18 , 1896 . A series of odd managerial decisions by Cluff led to his demotion ; however , in his last official act , he proposed to the Board that the Academy be named \" Brigham Young University \" . The suggestion received a large amount of opposition , with many members of the Board saying that the school was n't large enough to be a university , but the decision ultimately passed .
