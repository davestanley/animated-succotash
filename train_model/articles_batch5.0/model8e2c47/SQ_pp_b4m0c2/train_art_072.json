Musicologist Marcia Citron has asked \" [ w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard ' classical ' repertoire ? \" Citron \" examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received ' canon ' of performed musical works . \" She argues that in the 1800s , women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recitals rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall , with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers ; since women composers did not write many symphonies , they were deemed to be not notable as composers . In the \" ... Concise Oxford History of Music , Clara Shumann [ sic ] is one of the only [ sic ] female composers mentioned . \" Abbey Philips states that \" [ d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing / playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts . \"", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What type of view is that classical music is primarily written musical tradition?", "id": "56f75071aef2371900625afb", "answers": [{"text": "modernist", "answer_start": 4}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Musical notation is effective for what?", "id": "56f75071aef2371900625afc", "answers": [{"text": "transmitting classical music", "answer_start": 459}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why is written musical notation effective?
