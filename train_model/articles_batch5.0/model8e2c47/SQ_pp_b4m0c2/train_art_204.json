A predator at the top of any food chain ( that is , one that is preyed upon by no organism ) is called an apex predator ; examples include the orca , sperm whale , anaconda , Komodo dragon , tiger , lion , tiger shark , Nile crocodile , and most eagles and owls \u2014 and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears . An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat , such as a dog among alligators , a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray , or a snapping turtle among jaguars ; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators , such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments , can become an apex predator by default .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Dead animals that died as a result of natural causes or non-fatal injuries are called?", "id": "57266ea5dd62a815002e849a", "answers": [{"text": "carrion", "answer_start": 435}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why are species can be difficult to classify because they?", "id": "57266ea5dd62a815002e849b", "answers": [{"text": "eat from multiple levels of the food chain", "answer_start": 52}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are plants that eat both living species and consume sunlight for energy called?

A predator small enough to be prey for others , the domestic cat uses its formidable teeth and claws as weapons against animals that might confuse a cat with easier prey . Many non - predatory prey animals , such as a zebra , can give a strong kick that can maim or kill , while others charge with tusks or horns .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Is a species always the antagonist in a mobbing attack, or can it play roles on both sides?", "id": "5726e794f1498d1400e8ef74", "answers": [{"text": "species can be on both ends of a mobbing attack", "answer_start": 239}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which bird is an example of being both a predator and defender in mobbing attacks?", "id": "5726e794f1498d1400e8ef75", "answers": [{"text": "Crows", "answer_start": 288}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Will birds often mob animals that do not pose a threat?", "id": "5726e794f1498d1400e8ef76", "answers": [{"text": "On occasion", "answer_start": 499}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Crows will cooperate with small birds to drive away what predators?", "id": "5726e794f1498d1400e8ef77", "answers": [{"text": "hawks or larger mammalian predators", "answer_start": 462}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mobbing", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What is an activity usually done by mammalian predators?", "id": "5a6bd8644eec6b001a80a5de", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "show up", "answer_start": 132}], "question": "What will larger predators do when they see mobbing taking place?", "id": "5a6bd8644eec6b001a80a5df", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "watch", "answer_start": 168}], "question": "What is one thing hawks do when they see mobbing?", "id": "5a6bd8644eec6b001a80a5e0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "smaller songbirds", "answer_start": 319}], "question": "What are hawks often mobbed by when they try to eat their eggs?", "id": "5a6bd8644eec6b001a80a5e1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cooperate with smaller birds", "answer_start": 419}], "question": "What do hawks do when they want to drive away crows?", "id": "5a6bd8644eec6b001a80a5e2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Mobbing can be an interspecies activity: it is common for birds to respond to mobbing calls of a different species.

This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators . This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator . One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced ( something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible ) . An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species , giving the population a chance to recover , however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "How can natural predators benefit crops?", "id": "5726f545708984140094d6fd", "answers": [{"text": "reducing damage to crops, and are one alternative to the use of chemical agents such as pesticides", "answer_start": 565}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How are predators beneficial to agriculture?", "id": "5726f545708984140094d6fe", "answers": [{"text": "controlling pests", "answer_start": 458}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "If removing an introduced species entirely isn't a posibility, what is the next best outcome?", "id": "5726f545708984140094d6ff", "answers": [{"text": "keeping its abundance down", "answer_start": 164}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Predators are used in conservation to reduce what type of species from the environment?", "id": "5726f545708984140094d700", "answers": [{"text": "introduced species", "answer_start": 135}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "reducing damage", "answer_start": 565}], "question": "What is one way pesticides benefit crops?", "id": "5a6bfdbf4eec6b001a80a61a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "unforeseen problems", "answer_start": 361}], "question": "What is one thing that can happen if you use pesticides?", "id": "5a6bfdbf4eec6b001a80a61b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "keeping its abundance down", "answer_start": 164}], "question": "What is the only thing that is possible when removing pests?", "id": "5a6bfdbf4eec6b001a80a61c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "conservation biology", "answer_start": 403}], "question": "In what area are agricultural pests used for research?", "id": "5a6bfdbf4eec6b001a80a61d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "pesticides", "answer_start": 653}], "question": "What chemical agent is used to control introduced species?", "id": "5a6bfdbf4eec6b001a80a61e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Predators may be put to use in conservation efforts to control introduced species.
