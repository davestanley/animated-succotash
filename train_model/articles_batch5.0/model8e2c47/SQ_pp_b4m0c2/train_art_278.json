Among modern legal theorists , one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified : a formalist or \" thin \" definition , and a substantive or \" thick \" definition ; one occasionally encounters a third \" functional \" conception . Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the \" justness \" of law itself , but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law . Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on , or derived from , the rule of law .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "According to legal theorists, what characteristics must the rule of law have?", "id": "5727c3d12ca10214002d95c0", "answers": [{"text": "generality, equality, and certainty", "answer_start": 198}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "According to some, what is the rule of law is formed to protect?", "id": "5727c3d12ca10214002d95c1", "answers": [{"text": "individual rights", "answer_start": 408}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What system of government is considered as a component of the rule of law?", "id": "5727c3d12ca10214002d95c2", "answers": [{"text": "democracy", "answer_start": 645}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "According to some legal theorists, for what are there no requirements for something to be considered a law?", "id": "5727c3d12ca10214002d95c3", "answers": [{"text": "content", "answer_start": 284}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the two approaches to defining the concept of the rule of law?", "id": "5727c3d12ca10214002d95c4", "answers": [{"text": "formal and substantive", "answer_start": 554}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Most legal theorists", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Who believes that the rule of law has no formal characteristics?", "id": "5a3b16693ff257001ab843d5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty,", "answer_start": 175}], "question": "What characteristics do most legal theorists say the rule of law cannot possess?", "id": "5a3b16693ff257001ab843d6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the rule of law", "answer_start": 358}], "question": "What does not protect individual rights?", "id": "5a3b16693ff257001ab843d7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "formal and substantive", "answer_start": 554}], "question": "What two concepts defined rule without law?", "id": "5a3b16693ff257001ab843d8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics, meaning that the law must be publicly declared, with prospective application, and possess the characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty, but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law.
