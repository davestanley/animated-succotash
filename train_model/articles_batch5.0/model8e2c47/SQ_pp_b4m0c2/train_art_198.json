Competition was not the only reason for the department stores ' weakening strength ; the changing structure of cities also affected them . The compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth . But as residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs , the large , downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping malls .

During the course of the American occupation of the Philippines , many department stores were built throughout the city , many of which were located in Escolta . Heacock 's , a luxury department store , was considered as the best department store in the Orient . Other department stores included Aguinaldo 's , La Puerta del Sol , Estrella del Norte , and the Crystal Arcade , all of which were destroyed during the Battle of Manila in 1945 . After the war , department stores were once again alive with the establishment of Shoemart ( now SM ) , and Rustan 's . Since the foundation of these companies in the 1950s , there are now more than one hundred department stores to date . At present , due to the huge success of shopping malls , department stores in the Philippines usually are anchor tenants within malls . SM Supermalls and Robinsons Malls are two of the country 's most prominent mall chains , all of which has Department Store sections .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What department store in Puerto Rico is named after an American city?", "id": "5726746a708984140094c6b7", "answers": [{"text": "La New York", "answer_start": 186}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When is the Mall of San Juan expected to open?
