Echostar Satellite , No . 02 C 3293 , 65 Fed . R. Evid . Serv . 673 ( N.D. Ill. Oct. 15 , 2004 ) , a litigant attempted to use the Wayback Machine archives as a source of admissible evidence , perhaps for the first time . Telewizja Polska is the provider of TVP Polonia and EchoStar operates the Dish Network . Prior to the trial proceedings , EchoStar indicated that it intended to offer Wayback Machine snapshots as proof of the past content of Telewizja Polska 's web site . Telewizja Polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source , but Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys rejected Telewizja Polska 's assertion of hearsay and denied TVP 's motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial . At the trial , however , district Court Judge Ronald Guzman , the trial judge , overruled Magistrate Keys ' findings,[citation needed ] and held that neither the affidavit of the Internet Archive employee nor the underlying pages ( i.e. , the Telewizja Polska website ) were admissible as evidence . Judge Guzman reasoned that the employee 's affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements , and the purported web page printouts were not self - authenticating.[citation needed ]", "tags": "0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "When are Internet Archive timestamps useful for patent offices?", "id": "56ddca9d9a695914005b95d7", "answers": [{"text": "in examining a patent application", "answer_start": 375}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a condition that must be met for the Internet Archive data to be considered acceptable for submission to patent offices in the US and Europe?", "id": "56ddca9d9a695914005b95d8", "answers": [{"text": "authoritative statement of the archivist", "answer_start": 65}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "in examining a patent application", "answer_start": 375}], "question": "When are Internet Archive timestamps harmful for patent offices?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9ed8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "authoritative statement of the archivist", "answer_start": 65}], "question": "What is an example of a condition that must be met for the Internet Archive data to be considered acceptable for submission to patent offices on the Web?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9ed9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "dates", "answer_start": 294}], "question": "What are used to determine if a patent is available?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9eda", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "United States patent office and the European Patent Office", "answer_start": 112}], "question": "What will accept date stamps from the public?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9edb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "authoritative statement of the archivist", "answer_start": 65}], "question": "What does the patent offices require before they accept applications for employment?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9edc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Provided some additional requirements are met (e.g. providing an authoritative statement of the archivist), the United States patent office and the European Patent Office will accept date stamps from the Internet Archive as evidence of when a given Web page was accessible to the public.
