Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674 ; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period . At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance . The other two doors lead into the transept ; one , that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic , dates from the 14th century , the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u . The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height . The 18th - century restoration rounded the pointed arches , covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars , and redecorated the walls . The dome has no lantern , its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows . There are four chapels on either side , besides that at the end and those that open into the choir , the transept , and the sanctuary . It contains many paintings by eminent artists . A silver reredos , which was behind the altar , was carried away in the war of 1808 , and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign .

The town grew , and during the reign of Abd al - Aziz a new city wall was built , remains of which are preserved throughout the Old City ( Ciutat Vella ) today . The Castilian nobleman Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar , known as El Cid , who was intent on possessing his own principality on the Mediterranean , entered the province in command of a combined Christian and Moorish army and besieged the city beginning in 1092 . By the time the siege ended in May 1094 , he had carved out his own fiefdom \u2014 which he ruled from 15 June 1094 to July 1099 . This victory was immortalised in the Lay of the Cid . During his rule , he converted nine mosques into churches and installed the French monk J\u00e9r\u00f4me as bishop of the See of Valencia . El Cid was killed in July 1099 while defending the city from an Almoravid siege , whereupon his wife Ximena D\u00edaz ruled in his place for two years .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "When did Valencia suffer from the Black Death?", "id": "570d6c96b3d812140066d8cb", "answers": [{"text": "1348", "answer_start": 146}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which three religious groups lived in Valencia?", "id": "570d6c96b3d812140066d8cc", "answers": [{"text": "Christian, Jewish and Muslim", "answer_start": 589}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Muslims lived near what current market?", "id": "570d6c96b3d812140066d8cd", "answers": [{"text": "Mosen Sorel", "answer_start": 968}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the Jewish section attacked?", "id": "570d6c96b3d812140066d8ce", "answers": [{"text": "1391", "answer_start": 984}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the Muslim section attacked?", "id": "570d6c96b3d812140066d8cf", "answers": [{"text": "1456", "answer_start": 1229}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "The city went through serious troubles in the mid-fourteenth century.

It is situated in the centre of the ancient Roman city where some believe the temple of Diana stood. In Gothic times, it seems to have been dedicated to the Holy Saviour; the Cid dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin; King James I of Aragon did likewise, leaving in the main chapel the image of the Blessed Virgin, which he carried with him and is reputed to be the one now preserved in the sacristy. The Moorish mosque, which had been converted into a Christian Church by the conqueror, was deemed unworthy of the title of the cathedral of Valencia, and in 1262 Bishop Andr\u00e9s de Albalat laid the cornerstone of the new Gothic building, with three naves; these reach only to the choir of the present building. Bishop Vidal de Blanes built the chapter hall, and James I added the tower, called El Miguelete because it was blessed on St. Michael's day in 1418.
