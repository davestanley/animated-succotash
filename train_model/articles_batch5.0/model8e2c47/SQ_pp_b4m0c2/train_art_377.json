This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms . This is achievable in some well - studied bacteria , with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested . This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins , such as insulin , growth factors , or antibodies .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "When was the first time bacteria were observed?", "id": "572febaaa23a5019007fcb3f", "answers": [{"text": "1676", "answer_start": 82}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who discovered bacteria?", "id": "572febaaa23a5019007fcb40", "answers": [{"text": "Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek", "answer_start": 36}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How was he able to see bacteria?", "id": "572febaaa23a5019007fcb41", "answers": [{"text": "using a single-lens microscope of his own design", "answer_start": 88}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How long did it take for his discovery to be taken seriously?", "id": "572febaaa23a5019007fcb42", "answers": [{"text": "over a century", "answer_start": 470}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Bacteria were first observed by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, using a single-lens microscope of his own design.
