The Minister - President appoints a cabinet to run the state 's agencies and to carry out the executive duties of the state 's government .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What are the governments in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg called?", "id": "57292b1f6aef051400154b1c", "answers": [{"text": "Senate", "answer_start": 73}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " What is the government called in the three free states of Bavaria, Saxony, and Thuringia?", "id": "57292b1f6aef051400154b1d", "answers": [{"text": "the State Government", "answer_start": 173}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Bavaria's government have before 2001?", "id": "57292b1f6aef051400154b1e", "answers": [{"text": "a bicameral parliament", "answer_start": 329}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many people are in the executive branch senate in Berlin?", "id": "57292b1f6aef051400154b1f", "answers": [{"text": "eight", "answer_start": 716}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The parliament in Berlin is called what?", "id": "57292b1f6aef051400154b20", "answers": [{"text": "Abgeordnetenhaus", "answer_start": 1103}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "bicameral parliament", "answer_start": 331}], "question": "What kind of government did Bavaria have after 2001?", "id": "5a516c74ce860b001aa3fd9f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Bavaria", "answer_start": 317}], "question": "What state has an appointed Landtag?", "id": "5a516c74ce860b001aa3fda0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "representatives of the state's major social and economic groups", "answer_start": 411}], "question": "What is the Landtag of Bavaria made up of?", "id": "5a516c74ce860b001aa3fda1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "approximately eight", "answer_start": 702}], "question": "How many representatives are on the Senate of the legislative branch in Berlin?", "id": "5a516c74ce860b001aa3fda2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Regierender B\u00fcrgermeister", "answer_start": 1008}], "question": "What common name are the ministers in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg called?", "id": "5a516c74ce860b001aa3fda3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The governments in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg are designated by the term Senate.

Article 118 stated \" The division of the territory comprising Baden , W\u00fcrttemberg - Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg - Hohenzollern into L\u00e4nder may be revised , without regard to the provisions of Article 29 , by agreement between the L\u00e4nder concerned . If no agreement is reached , the revision shall be effected by a federal law , which shall provide for an advisory referendum . \" Since no agreement was reached , a referendum was held on 9 December 1951 in four different voting districts , three of which approved the merger ( South Baden refused but was overruled as the result of total votes was decisive ) . On 25 April 1952 , the three former states merged to form Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}]}, "version": ["v2.0"]}
