There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \"coloured\" are today described as \"black\", or \"of African heritage\", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as \"coloured\" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians , other than those characterising recent immigrant communities . In the 17th century , this was not so . For the first hundred years of settlement , white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority , with white minorities of Irish ( the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic ) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War . Non - white minorities included Spanish - speaking , free ( indentured ) blacks from the West Indies , black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers , and Native Americans , primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard , but possibly from as far away as Mexico . By the 19th century , the white ethnically - English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage . Despite the banning of the importation of Irish , and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them , the merging of the various minority groups , along with some of the white English , had resulted in a new demographic group , \" coloured \" ( which term , in Bermuda , referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry ) Bermudians , gaining a slight majority .

This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda , holding a match at Somerset to mark forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery . The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the St. George 's Garrison ( the original army headquarters in Bermuda ) on Barrack Hill , St. George 's , and the Royal Naval Dockyard at Ireland Island . Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George 's Cricket Club in this game ( the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian ) .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What events did Bermuda compete in at the 2004 Summer Olympics?", "id": "57295b726aef051400154d56", "answers": [{"text": "sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events", "answer_start": 49}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Katura Horton-Perinchief do?", "id": "57295b726aef051400154d57", "answers": [{"text": "made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the Olympic Games.", "answer_start": 174}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the only medal Bermuda has ever won?", "id": "57295b726aef051400154d58", "answers": [{"text": "bronze medal in boxing.", "answer_start": 325}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the Olympic tradition for Bermuda, regardless of season?", "id": "57295b726aef051400154d59", "answers": [{"text": "march in the Opening Ceremony in Bermuda shorts", "answer_start": 584}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.", "answer_start": 49}], "question": "What events did Bermuda participate in during the 2004 winter olympics?", "id": "5ad42d05604f3c001a40094b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the Olympic Games.", "answer_start": 174}], "question": "What did Katura Perinchief-Horton do?", "id": "5ad42d05604f3c001a40094c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Men's Skeleton", "answer_start": 374}], "question": "What event did Bermuda participate in during the 2006 summer olympics?", "id": "5ad42d05604f3c001a40094d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jillian Teceira", "answer_start": 495}], "question": "Who competed at the Beijing Olympics in 213?", "id": "5ad42d05604f3c001a40094e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "biennial Island Games", "answer_start": 718}], "question": "What games did Bermuda host in 2008?", "id": "5ad42d05604f3c001a40094f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.
