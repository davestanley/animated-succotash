Apart from its fast 40 MHz 68030 processor , it had significant internal architectural improvements , including faster memory and two Apple II CPUs ( 6502s ) dedicated to I / O processing .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which Mac is known for improving the handling of color graphics?", "id": "570ce1a4b3d812140066d2d7", "answers": [{"text": "Mac OS, System 7", "answer_start": 7}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Apple pay expensive consulting fees to before doing in-house work?", "id": "570ce1a4b3d812140066d2d8", "answers": [{"text": "Frogdesign", "answer_start": 359}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was established for bringing Apple's design work in-house?", "id": "570ce1a4b3d812140066d2d9", "answers": [{"text": "the Apple Industrial Design Group", "answer_start": 434}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was responsible for crafting a new look for all Apple products?", "id": "570ce1a4b3d812140066d2da", "answers": [{"text": "Apple Industrial Design Group", "answer_start": 438}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How did the Mac System 7 improve multitasking?", "id": "570ce1a4b3d812140066d2db", "answers": [{"text": "co-operative multitasking", "answer_start": 186}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mac OS, System 7", "answer_start": 7}], "question": "Which Mac is known for improving the handling of non-color graphics?", "id": "5ad55c955b96ef001a10acbc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Frogdesign", "answer_start": 359}], "question": "Who did Microsoft pay expensive consulting fees to before doing in-house work?", "id": "5ad55c955b96ef001a10acbd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Apple Industrial Design Group", "answer_start": 438}], "question": "What was established for bringing Microsoft's design work in-house?", "id": "5ad55c955b96ef001a10acbe", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Apple Industrial Design Group", "answer_start": 438}], "question": "Who was responsible for crafting a new look for all Microsoft products?", "id": "5ad55c955b96ef001a10acbf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "co-operative multitasking", "answer_start": 186}], "question": "How did the Mac System 6 improve multitasking?", "id": "5ad55c955b96ef001a10acc0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "As for Mac OS, System 7 was a 32-bit rewrite from Pascal to C++ that introduced virtual memory and improved the handling of color graphics, as well as memory addressing, networking, and co-operative multitasking.

Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011 , however , and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which technique was once used to boot an alternate operating system than Mac OS?", "id": "570cf06efed7b91900d45b19", "answers": [{"text": "boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a Mac OS-based bootloader application", "answer_start": 187}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was introduced that made using Mac OS alternative operating systems easier?", "id": "570cf06efed7b91900d45b1a", "answers": [{"text": "Open Firmware-based PCI Macs", "answer_start": 381}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What were Open Firmware-based PCI Macs used as a convenience because of?", "id": "570cf06efed7b91900d45b1b", "answers": [{"text": "bugs in the firmware implementation", "answer_start": 492}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where does Mac hardware boot directly to in all Intel-based Macs?", "id": "570cf06efed7b91900d45b1c", "answers": [{"text": "EFI", "answer_start": 628}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where does Mac harware boot directly to in most PowerPC-based Macs?", "id": "570cf06efed7b91900d45b1d", "answers": [{"text": "Open Firmware", "answer_start": 584}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a Mac OS-based bootloader application", "answer_start": 187}], "question": "Which technique was once used to boot an alternate operating system than Mac SO?", "id": "5ad563615b96ef001a10ad76", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Open Firmware-based PCI Macs", "answer_start": 381}], "question": "What was introduced that made using Mac OP alternative operating systems easier?", "id": "5ad563615b96ef001a10ad77", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "bugs in the firmware implementation", "answer_start": 492}], "question": "What were Open Firmware-based PIC Macs used as a convenience because of?", "id": "5ad563615b96ef001a10ad78", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "EFI", "answer_start": 628}], "question": "Where does Mac hardware boot indirectly to in all Intel-based Macs?", "id": "5ad563615b96ef001a10ad79", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Open Firmware", "answer_start": 584}], "question": "Where does Mac harware boot indirectly to in most PowerPC-based Macs?", "id": "5ad563615b96ef001a10ad7a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Originally, the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the Mac OS operating system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system.

The ad alludes to George Orwell 's novel , Nineteen Eighty - Four , which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised \" Big Brother . \"", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "When was the Macintosh branded as Mac?", "id": "570cfff3fed7b91900d45bad", "answers": [{"text": "1997", "answer_start": 61}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who designed, develped, and marketed the Mac computers?", "id": "570cfff3fed7b91900d45bae", "answers": [{"text": "Apple Inc.", "answer_start": 144}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Steve Jobs introduce on January 24, 1984?", "id": "570cfff3fed7b91900d45baf", "answers": [{"text": "original Macintosh computer", "answer_start": 181}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What interface type did the original Macintosh include?", "id": "570cfff3fed7b91900d45bb0", "answers": [{"text": "integral graphical user", "answer_start": 292}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Apple begin phasing out Macintosh in favor of \"Mac\"?", "id": "570cfff3fed7b91900d45bb1", "answers": [{"text": "Since 1998", "answer_start": 527}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1997", "answer_start": 61}], "question": "When was the Microsoft branded as Mac?", "id": "5ad4ffc25b96ef001a10a8e0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Apple Inc.", "answer_start": 144}], "question": "Who designed, develped, and marketed the IBM computers?", "id": "5ad4ffc25b96ef001a10a8e1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "original Macintosh computer", "answer_start": 181}], "question": "What did Steve Jobs introduce on January 24, 1988?", "id": "5ad4ffc25b96ef001a10a8e2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "integral graphical user interface and mouse", "answer_start": 292}], "question": "What interface type did the original Macintosh exclude?", "id": "5ad4ffc25b96ef001a10a8e3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1998", "answer_start": 533}], "question": "When did Microsoft begin phasing out Macintosh in favor of \"Mac\"?", "id": "5ad4ffc25b96ef001a10a8e4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Macintosh (/\u02c8m\u00e6k\u1d7bnt\u0252\u0283/ MAK-in-tosh; branded as Mac since 1997) is a series of personal computers (PCs) designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc.

The use of Intel microprocessors has helped Macs more directly compete with their Windows counterparts on price and performance , and by the 2010s Apple was receiving Intel 's latest CPUs first before other PC manufacturers .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did Apple consolidate in 1998?", "id": "570d2cb4fed7b91900d45cb1", "answers": [{"text": "its multiple consumer-level desktop models", "answer_start": 60}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What all-in-one product was created in 1998 through Apple's consolidations?", "id": "570d2cb4fed7b91900d45cb2", "answers": [{"text": "iMac G3", "answer_start": 123}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the iMac G3 do to the Mac reputation?", "id": "570d2cb4fed7b91900d45cb3", "answers": [{"text": "revitalized the brand", "answer_start": 170}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was Mac's Xserve server discontinued?", "id": "570d2cb4fed7b91900d45cb4", "answers": [{"text": "2011", "answer_start": 592}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What took the place of Mac's Xserve server?", "id": "570d2cb4fed7b91900d45cb5", "answers": [{"text": "Mac Mini and Mac Pro", "answer_start": 613}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "its multiple consumer-level desktop models", "answer_start": 60}], "question": "What did Apple consolidate in 1989?", "id": "5ad500c15b96ef001a10a908", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "iMac G3", "answer_start": 123}], "question": "What all-in-one product was created in 1989 through Apple's consolidations?", "id": "5ad500c15b96ef001a10a909", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "revitalized the brand", "answer_start": 170}], "question": "What did the iMac G2 do to the Mac reputation?", "id": "5ad500c15b96ef001a10a90a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2011", "answer_start": 592}], "question": "When was Mac's Xserve server continued?", "id": "5ad500c15b96ef001a10a90b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mac Mini and Mac Pro", "answer_start": 613}], "question": "What took the place of Mac's iserve server?", "id": "5ad500c15b96ef001a10a90c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In 1998, after the return of Steve Jobs, Apple consolidated its multiple consumer-level desktop models into the all-in-one iMac G3, which became a commercial success and revitalized the brand.

Since 2010 , Apple has also offered the Magic Trackpad as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What type of software began to emerge following the release of Intel-based Macs?", "id": "570d395db3d812140066d57f", "answers": [{"text": "third-party platform virtualization", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "At what speed do programs such as VirtualBox allow Microsoft Windows to run on Macs?", "id": "570d395db3d812140066d580", "answers": [{"text": "at near native speed", "answer_start": 258}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is possible to run by using Boot camp, even though it is not condoned by Apple?", "id": "570d395db3d812140066d581", "answers": [{"text": "the Linux operating system", "answer_start": 495}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do Macs lack that makes them unable to run many legacy PC operating systems?", "id": "570d395db3d812140066d582", "answers": [{"text": "the A20 gate", "answer_start": 695}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "third-party platform virtualization", "answer_start": 43}], "question": "What type of hardware began to emerge following the release of Intel-based Macs?", "id": "5ad563b95b96ef001a10ad80", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "at near native speed", "answer_start": 258}], "question": "At what speed do programs such as VirtualBox allow Microsoft DOS to run on Macs?", "id": "5ad563b95b96ef001a10ad81", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Linux operating system", "answer_start": 495}], "question": "What is possible to run by using Boot camp, even though it is not condoned by Microsoft?", "id": "5ad563b95b96ef001a10ad82", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "A20 gate", "answer_start": 699}], "question": "What do Macs lack that makes them able to run many legacy PC operating systems?", "id": "5ad563b95b96ef001a10ad83", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "A20 gate", "answer_start": 699}], "question": "What do Macs have that makes them unable to run many legacy PC operating systems?", "id": "5ad563b95b96ef001a10ad84", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Following the release of Intel-based Macs, third-party platform virtualization software such as Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion, and VirtualBox began to emerge.
