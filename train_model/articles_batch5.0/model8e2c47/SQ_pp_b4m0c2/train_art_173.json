By 2014 , Israel 's desalination programs provided roughly 35 % of Israel 's drinking water and it is expected to supply 40 % by 2015 and 70 % by 2050 . As of May 29 , 2015 more than 50 percent of the water for Israeli households , agriculture and industry is artificially produced . As a result of innovations in reverse osmosis technology , Israel is set to become a net exporter of water in the coming years .", "tags": "0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "How many homes in Israel use solar energy for hot water?", "id": "5725cfb4271a42140099d21f", "answers": [{"text": "Over 90%", "answer_start": 158}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much electricity does the country save per year?", "id": "5725cfb4271a42140099d220", "answers": [{"text": "8%", "answer_start": 304}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Better Place shut down?", "id": "5725cfb4271a42140099d221", "answers": [{"text": "2013", "answer_start": 1109}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Israel has embraced solar energy; its engineers are on the cutting edge of solar energy technology and its solar companies work on projects around the world.
