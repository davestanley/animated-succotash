These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led James Hutton , Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart , following in the steps of Steno , to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained : a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin . The use of index fossils became a powerful tool for making geological maps , because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other , distant localities . Over the first half of the 19th century , geologists such as Charles Lyell , Adam Sedgwick , and Roderick Murchison applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America , setting the stage for more detailed , government - funded mapping projects in later decades .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What changed about the way geology was implemented during the 19th century?", "id": "57282a294b864d190016462e", "answers": [{"text": "shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand how the surface of the Earth had changed", "answer_start": 54}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The idea of an ice-age that completely covered a continent was suggested by whom?", "id": "57282a294b864d190016462f", "answers": [{"text": "Louis Agassiz", "answer_start": 318}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What group did Andrew Crombie Ramsay belong to?", "id": "57282a294b864d1900164630", "answers": [{"text": "fluvialists", "answer_start": 404}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Ramsay believe about river valleys?", "id": "57282a294b864d1900164631", "answers": [{"text": "were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them", "answer_start": 470}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What happened after radioactivity was realized?", "id": "57282a294b864d1900164632", "answers": [{"text": "radiometric dating methods were developed", "answer_start": 582}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Midway through the 19th century, the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand how the surface of the Earth had changed.

Max Weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization , which he believed would trap individuals in an \" iron cage \" of rational thought . Some sociologists , including Georg Simmel and W. E. B. Du Bois , utilized more microsociological , qualitative analyses . This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology , with the theories of George Herbert Mead and his student Herbert Blumer resulting in the creation of the symbolic interactionism approach to sociology .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who was the major proponent of American sociology?", "id": "5728339a2ca10214002da096", "answers": [{"text": "Talcott Parsons", "answer_start": 67}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Parsons believe made a functional society?", "id": "5728339a2ca10214002da097", "answers": [{"text": "structural integration", "answer_start": 133}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the problem with the views of Parsons?", "id": "5728339a2ca10214002da098", "answers": [{"text": "inequalities present in the status quo", "answer_start": 327}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What idea from Karl Marx was used to combat the problems with structural integration?", "id": "5728339a2ca10214002da099", "answers": [{"text": "conflict theory", "answer_start": 380}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the main belief of conflict theory?", "id": "5728339a2ca10214002da09a", "answers": [{"text": "different groups compete for control over resources", "answer_start": 521}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by Talcott Parsons, who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore \"functional\".
