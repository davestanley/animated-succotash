Davorjanka died of tuberculosis in 1946 and Tito insisted that she be buried in the backyard of the Beli Dvor , his Belgrade residence .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who was Tito's best known wife?", "id": "56f82ae4a6d7ea1400e1744d", "answers": [{"text": "Jovanka Broz", "answer_start": 24}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How old was Jovanka Broz when she married Tito?", "id": "56f82ae4a6d7ea1400e1744e", "answers": [{"text": "27", "answer_start": 92}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Tito and Jovanka marry?", "id": "56f82ae4a6d7ea1400e1744f", "answers": [{"text": "1952", "answer_start": 131}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was the best man at the wedding of Jovanka and Tito?", "id": "56f82ae4a6d7ea1400e17450", "answers": [{"text": "Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107", "answer_start": 163}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who went down in history as Yugoslavia's first lady?", "id": "56f82ae4a6d7ea1400e17451", "answers": [{"text": "Jovanka", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "His best known wife was Jovanka Broz.
