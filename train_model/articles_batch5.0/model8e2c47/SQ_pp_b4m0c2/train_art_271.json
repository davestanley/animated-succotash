This is an increasing disadvantage compared to USB . Even though USB 3.0 's 4.5 W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives , technology is advancing and external drives gradually need less power , diminishing the eSATA advantage . eSATAp ( power over eSATA ; aka ESATA / USB ) is a connector introduced in 2009 that supplies power to attached devices using a new , backward compatible , connector . On a notebook eSATAp usually supplies only 5 V to power a 2.5-inch HDD / SSD ; on a desktop workstation it can additionally supply 12 V to power larger devices including 3.5-inch HDD / SSD and 5.25-inch optical drives .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "USB 2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip (HSIC) is a what?", "id": "5728089f2ca10214002d9c12", "answers": [{"text": "chip-to-chip variant of USB 2.0", "answer_start": 42}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does USB 2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip eliminate?", "id": "5728089f2ca10214002d9c13", "answers": [{"text": "the conventional analog transceivers found in normal USB", "answer_start": 90}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the USB 2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip adopted as the standard by the USB Implementers Forum", "id": "5728089f2ca10214002d9c14", "answers": [{"text": "2007", "answer_start": 210}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "USB 2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip (HSIC) is a chip-to-chip variant of USB 2.0 that eliminates the conventional analog transceivers found in normal USB.
