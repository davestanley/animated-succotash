The Eclogues (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (\"pastoral poetry\") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident.

In the 12th century , starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe , a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician . Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . Virgil 's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name , Fferyllt or Pheryllt , became a generic term for magic - worker , and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "During which time period did the legend of Virgil in his Basket arise?", "id": "56f8a4a59e9bad19000a0249", "answers": [{"text": "Middle Ages", "answer_start": 48}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the beautiful woman who Virgil enamoured?", "id": "56f8a4a59e9bad19000a024a", "answers": [{"text": "Lucretia", "answer_start": 357}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which story did Virgil being left halfway in basket parallel?", "id": "56f8a4a59e9bad19000a024b", "answers": [{"text": "Phyllis riding Aristotle", "answer_start": 686}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which artist made a woodcut and later an engraving of Virgil and his basket?", "id": "56f8a4a59e9bad19000a024c", "answers": [{"text": "Lucas van Leyden", "answer_start": 753}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Middle Ages", "answer_start": 44}], "question": "When did Lucas van Leyden live?", "id": "5a7e68d448f7d9001a0636b7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the emperor's daughter", "answer_start": 311}], "question": "What was Phyllis known as?", "id": "5a7e68d448f7d9001a0636b8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Aristotle", "answer_start": 701}], "question": "Who was one of the writers who wrote about Virgil in his Basket?", "id": "5a7e68d448f7d9001a0636b9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "engraving", "answer_start": 798}], "question": "What form of art did the most artists use to depict Virgil in his Basket?", "id": "5a7e68d448f7d9001a0636ba", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Middle Ages", "answer_start": 44}], "question": "When did Phyllis ride Aristotle?", "id": "5a7e68d448f7d9001a0636bb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The legend of Virgil in his Basket arose in the Middle Ages, and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the Power of Women literary topos, demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men.
