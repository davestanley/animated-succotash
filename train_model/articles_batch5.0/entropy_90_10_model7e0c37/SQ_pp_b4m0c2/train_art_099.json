Antigen - presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells . Also , T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-12 , and IFN - g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage . B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In babies, what is another element impacting immune response?", "id": "5706e36d9e06ca38007e91e1", "answers": [{"text": "Maternal factors", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Newborns can acquire antibodies from the mother through what means?", "id": "5706e36d9e06ca38007e91e2", "answers": [{"text": "breast milk", "answer_start": 246}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "For how long do these antibodies have an effect on infants?", "id": "5706e36d9e06ca38007e91e3", "answers": [{"text": "up to 18 months", "answer_start": 323}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "At 6 to 9 months, an infant's immune system begins to respond to which proteins?", "id": "5706e36d9e06ca38007e91e4", "answers": [{"text": "glycoproteins", "answer_start": 1004}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The difference in responses in infant immune systems is the cause of what?", "id": "5706e36d9e06ca38007e91e5", "answers": [{"text": "distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules", "answer_start": 1164}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Maternal factors also play a role in the body\u2019s immune response.
