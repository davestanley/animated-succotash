Oriental Patriarchs who are created Cardinals customarily use \" Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis \" as their full title , probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What way is used to announce the election of a new pope in Latin?", "id": "56ddee7066d3e219004dae25", "answers": [{"text": "[First name] Cardinal [Surname]", "answer_start": 33}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What should the new pople have been before becoming a pope?", "id": "56ddee7066d3e219004dae26", "answers": [{"text": "Cardinal", "answer_start": 46}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the most recent election of a non-cardinal?", "id": "56ddee7066d3e219004dae27", "answers": [{"text": "1378", "answer_start": 630}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When is the last time a non cardinal was elected as pope?", "id": "56df090bc65bf219000b3ef1", "answers": [{"text": "1378", "answer_start": 630}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "[First name] Cardinal [Surname]", "answer_start": 33}], "question": "What way is used in the proclamation of the election of a new nun in Latin?", "id": "5ad2f1ba604f3c001a3fda1f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Cardinal", "answer_start": 441}], "question": "What should a new pope not have been before becoming a pope?", "id": "5ad2f1ba604f3c001a3fda20", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum;
