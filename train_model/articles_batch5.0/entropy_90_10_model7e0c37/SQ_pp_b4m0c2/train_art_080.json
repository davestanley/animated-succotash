Two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were Horace - B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure ( 1740\u20131799 ) in the Pennine Alps , and the Benedictine monk of Disentis Placidus a Spescha ( 1752\u20131833 ) . Born in Geneva , Saussure was enamored with the mountains from an early age ; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland , the Savoy , the Piedmont and Valais , studying the glaciers and the geology , as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval . Saussure , in 1787 , was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc \u2014 today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed .", "tags": "1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty?", "id": "56f8c60f9e9bad19000a0484", "answers": [{"text": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who wrote the poem Die Alpen?", "id": "56f8c60f9e9bad19000a0485", "answers": [{"text": "Albrecht von Haller", "answer_start": 277}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the Alpine countries see an influx of poets, artists, and musicians?", "id": "56f8c60f9e9bad19000a0486", "answers": [{"text": "After the end of the Napoleonic Wars", "answer_start": 638}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the visitors come to experience in the Alpine countries?", "id": "56f8c60f9e9bad19000a0487", "answers": [{"text": "the sublime effects of monumental nature", "answer_start": 785}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons.
