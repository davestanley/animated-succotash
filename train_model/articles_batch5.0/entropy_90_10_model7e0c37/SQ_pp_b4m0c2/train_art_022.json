In fact , the evolution of all eukaryotes ( plants , animals , fungi , and protists ) is believed under the endosymbiotic theory to have resulted from a symbiosis between various sorts of bacteria . This theory is supported by certain organelles dividing independently of the cell , and the observation that some organelles seem to have their own nucleic acid .", "tags": "0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does Margulis think is the main driver of evolution?", "id": "56de4796cffd8e1900b4b777", "answers": [{"text": "symbiosis", "answer_start": 56}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who agrees with Margulis' cooperative view of evolution?", "id": "56de4796cffd8e1900b4b779", "answers": [{"text": "Dorion Sagan", "answer_start": 357}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "endosymbiosis", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "What is the biologist Darwin famous for?", "id": "5a80193e8f0597001ac00193", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "evolution", "answer_start": 234}], "question": "What is strongly based only upon uncooperative interaction and independence?", "id": "5a80193e8f0597001ac00194", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Lynn Margulis", "answer_start": 14}], "question": "Who was the last to utter this quote \"Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking.\"?", "id": "5a80193e8f0597001ac00195", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "symbiosis", "answer_start": 81}], "question": "What is not considered a driving force behind evolution?", "id": "5a80193e8f0597001ac00196", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Darwin", "answer_start": 148}], "question": "Who currently disagrees with Margulis' cooperative view of evolution?", "id": "5a80193e8f0597001ac00197", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The biologist Lynn Margulis, famous for her work on endosymbiosis, contends that symbiosis is a major driving force behind evolution.
