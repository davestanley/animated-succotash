Some of Dell Inc 's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year , free bonus products ( such as Dell printers ) , and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors . In 2006 , Dell cut its prices in an effort to maintain its 19.2 % market share . This also cut profit - margins by more than half , from 8.7 to 4.3 percent . To maintain its low prices , Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the Internet and through the telephone network , and to move its customer - care division to India and El Salvador .", "tags": "1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What year did Dell make an agreement with Officeworks?", "id": "570fc9cd5ab6b81900390fe1", "answers": [{"text": "2008", "answer_start": 7}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What computer model did Dell ask Officeworks to carry?", "id": "570fc9cd5ab6b81900390fe2", "answers": [{"text": "Inspiron", "answer_start": 138}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which country did Dell partner with Harris Technology?", "id": "570fc9cd5ab6b81900390fe3", "answers": [{"text": "Australian", "answer_start": 326}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What company did Dell team with in late 2008?", "id": "570fc9cd5ab6b81900390fe4", "answers": [{"text": "Dick Smith Electronics", "answer_start": 746}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year did Dell's Australian program end up shutting down?", "id": "570fc9cd5ab6b81900390fe5", "answers": [{"text": "2010", "answer_start": 1241}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2008", "answer_start": 7}], "question": "What year did Dell make a disagreement with Officeworks?", "id": "5ad36acb604f3c001a3fe131", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Inspiron", "answer_start": 138}], "question": "What computer model didn't Dell ask Officeworks to carry?", "id": "5ad36acb604f3c001a3fe132", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Australian", "answer_start": 326}], "question": "In which country did Dell cut ties with Harris Technology?", "id": "5ad36acb604f3c001a3fe133", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Dick Smith Electronics", "answer_start": 746}], "question": "What company did Dell team with in late 2009?", "id": "5ad36acb604f3c001a3fe134", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2010", "answer_start": 1241}], "question": "What year didn't Dell's Australian program end up shutting down?", "id": "5ad36acb604f3c001a3fe135", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range.

A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat - panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 ( US$ 15,120 ) , less than a third of the normal price . The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes , as the prestigious firm said the company mispriced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks .", "tags": "0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Innovations in what kind of management is Dell known for?", "id": "570fdcbb80d9841400ab36e3", "answers": [{"text": "supply chain", "answer_start": 252}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What sales model did Dell follow?", "id": "570fdcbb80d9841400ab36e4", "answers": [{"text": "direct-sales", "answer_start": 318}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "For the majority of Dell's existence, what were they a vendor of?", "id": "570fdcbb80d9841400ab36e5", "answers": [{"text": "hardware", "answer_start": 493}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What company did Dell acquire in 2009?", "id": "570fdcbb80d9841400ab36e6", "answers": [{"text": "Perot Systems", "answer_start": 572}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What market did Dell begin to compete in in 2009?", "id": "570fdcbb80d9841400ab36e7", "answers": [{"text": "IT services", "answer_start": 615}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "direct-sales", "answer_start": 318}], "question": "What sales model didn't Dell follow?", "id": "5ad355e1604f3c001a3fddc1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "supply chain", "answer_start": 252}], "question": "Innovations in what kind of management is Dell unknown for?", "id": "5ad355e1604f3c001a3fddc2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "hardware", "answer_start": 493}], "question": "For the minority of Dell's existence, what were they a vendor of?", "id": "5ad355e1604f3c001a3fddc3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Perot Systems", "answer_start": 572}], "question": "What company did Dell acquire in 2008?", "id": "5ad355e1604f3c001a3fddc4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "IT services", "answer_start": 615}], "question": "What market did Dell begin to compete in in 2011?", "id": "5ad355e1604f3c001a3fddc5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Dell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, MP3 players, and electronics built by other manufacturers.
