The prefix of the URL , the Uniform Resource Identifier or URI , determines how the URL will be interpreted . The most commonly used kind of URI starts with http : and identifies a resource to be retrieved over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) . Many browsers also support a variety of other prefixes , such as https : for HTTPS , ftp : for the File Transfer Protocol , and file : for local files . Prefixes that the web browser can not directly handle are often handed off to another application entirely . For example , mailto : URIs are usually passed to the user 's default e - mail application , and news : URIs are passed to the user 's default newsgroup reader .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is it called when content is changed from markup to an interactive document?", "id": "56e0d21b7aa994140058e74f", "answers": [{"text": "rendering", "answer_start": 319}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Browsers typically have plug-ins to support what?", "id": "56e0d21b7aa994140058e750", "answers": [{"text": "Flash applications and Java applets", "answer_start": 533}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Flash applications and Java applets", "answer_start": 533}], "question": "Browsers have you save to disk so they can support what?", "id": "5a4d48dd7a6c4c001a2bbca2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "\"rendering\"", "answer_start": 318}], "question": "What is it called when resources are changed from being unsupported to being downloaded?", "id": "5a4d48dd7a6c4c001a2bbca3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "http, https, file, and others", "answer_start": 15}], "question": "What files can be displayed when a file is unsupported?", "id": "5a4d48dd7a6c4c001a2bbca4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "any kind", "answer_start": 383}], "question": "What unsupported content can resources display that is part of a webpage?", "id": "5a4d48dd7a6c4c001a2bbca5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "passed to the browser's layout engine to be transformed from markup to an interactive document", "answer_start": 203}], "question": "What process happens to plug-ins saved to disk?", "id": "5a4d48dd7a6c4c001a2bbca6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In the case of http, https, file, and others, once the resource has been retrieved the web browser will display it.
