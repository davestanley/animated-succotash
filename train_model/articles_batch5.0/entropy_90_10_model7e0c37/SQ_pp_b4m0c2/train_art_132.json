In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November , the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks ; the albums were OU812 , Hysteria , Appetite for Destruction , and New Jersey . A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s , and experienced success with multi - platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s , among them Extreme , Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse . Skid Row also released their eponymous d\u00e9but ( 1989 ) , reaching number six on the Billboard 200 , but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What hard rock supergroup contained members of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine?", "id": "570b745a6b8089140040f974", "answers": [{"text": "Audioslave", "answer_start": 1074}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the title of Bon Jovi's 2000 hit single?", "id": "570b745a6b8089140040f975", "answers": [{"text": "\"It's My Life\"", "answer_start": 161}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What band released an album called Stiff Upper Lip in 2000?", "id": "570b745a6b8089140040f976", "answers": [{"text": "AC/DC", "answer_start": 237}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots?", "id": "570b745a6b8089140040f977", "answers": [{"text": "Scott Weiland", "answer_start": 1264}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was Guns N Roses long delayed 2008 album called?", "id": "570b745a6b8089140040f978", "answers": [{"text": "Chinese Democracy", "answer_start": 1433}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "AC/DC", "answer_start": 237}], "question": "Which band beside Bon Jovi were two rock bands that had very little commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s?", "id": "5a5a50d49c0277001abe7110", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2000", "answer_start": 292}], "question": "What year did Bon Jovi release their album Stiff Upper Lip?", "id": "5a5a50d49c0277001abe7111", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Red Velvet Car", "answer_start": 582}], "question": "What top 10 album by Heart was released in the early 90s?", "id": "5a5a50d49c0277001abe7112", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "John Entwistle", "answer_start": 845}], "question": "What bassist for The Who died in 2006?", "id": "5a5a50d49c0277001abe7113", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Chinese Democracy", "answer_start": 1433}], "question": "What Guns N' Roses album that was released in 2008 was there most successful album to date?", "id": "5a5a50d49c0277001abe7114", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.
