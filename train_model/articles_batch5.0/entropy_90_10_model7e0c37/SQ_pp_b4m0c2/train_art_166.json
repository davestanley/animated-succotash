In addition , social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to \" pass \" as white . Diverse immigration has brought more mixed - race people into the United States , such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos . Since the 1980s , the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement ( cf . Loving Day ) . Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins , the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno - racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial . In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States ; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What were put in place to prevent the mix of races?", "id": "571a441a10f8ca1400304f93", "answers": [{"text": "Anti-miscegenation laws", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why did the anti-miscegenation not insure that there was no interracial mixing?", "id": "571a441a10f8ca1400304f94", "answers": [{"text": "white men from taking slave women as concubines and having multiracial children with them", "answer_start": 174}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was there greater numbers of Latinos and Asian residents?", "id": "571a441a10f8ca1400304f95", "answers": [{"text": "In California and the western US", "answer_start": 265}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What races were prohibited from official relationships with whites?", "id": "571a441a10f8ca1400304f96", "answers": [{"text": "Latino and Asian residents", "answer_start": 329}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When were the laws against marriage between Asians and Europeans lifted?", "id": "571a441a10f8ca1400304f97", "answers": [{"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 518}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When were anti-miscegenation laws passed?", "id": "571a9c0e10f8ca14003051a9", "answers": [{"text": "Anti-miscegenation laws were passed in most states during the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Did these laws change behavior of white slaveholders and other powerful white men?", "id": "571a9c0e10f8ca14003051aa", "answers": [{"text": "this did not prevent white slaveholders, their sons, or other powerful white men from taking slave women as concubines", "answer_start": 103}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which region has greater numbers of Latino and Asian residents?", "id": "571a9c0e10f8ca14003051ab", "answers": [{"text": "In California and the western US,", "answer_start": 265}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Were there any laws against marriage between whites and Asians in the US?", "id": "571a9c0e10f8ca14003051ac", "answers": [{"text": "White legislators passed laws prohibiting marriage between European and Asian Americans until the 1950s.", "answer_start": 420}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Were Latino residents also prohibited from marrying whites?

The term may also include Americans of mixed - race ancestry who self - identify with just one group culturally and socially ( cf . the one - drop rule ) . In the 2010 US census , approximately 9 million individuals , or 2.9 % of the population , self - identified as multiracial . There is evidence that an accounting by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number , but people live according to social and cultural identities , not DNA . Historical reasons , including slavery creating a racial caste and the European - American suppression of Native Americans , often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity , generally that of the culture in which they were raised . Prior to the mid-20th century , many people hid their multiracial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities . While many Americans may be biologically multiracial , they often do not know it or do not identify so culturally , any more than they maintain all the differing traditions of a variety of national ancestries .", "tags": "1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What occured from 1955 to 1968?", "id": "571de14eb64a571400c71dc6", "answers": [{"text": "The African-American Civil Rights Movement", "answer_start": 308}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much of the population identified as mixed race in the 2000s?", "id": "571de14eb64a571400c71dc7", "answers": [{"text": "less than 5%", "answer_start": 551}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is race sometimes seen as?", "id": "571de14eb64a571400c71dc8", "answers": [{"text": "a social construct", "answer_start": 213}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who are descendents of various culturally distinct groups?", "id": "571de14eb64a571400c71dc9", "answers": [{"text": "The American people", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does affect recent identification in many cases?", "id": "571de14eb64a571400c71dca", "answers": [{"text": "mixed racial ancestry", "answer_start": 628}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "culturally distinct immigrant groups", "answer_start": 67}], "question": "What are the English people mostly descendants of?", "id": "5ad29605d7d075001a429b04", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1955\u20131968", "answer_start": 352}], "question": "When did the Hispanic Civil Rights Movement occur?", "id": "5ad29605d7d075001a429b05", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "less than 5%", "answer_start": 551}], "question": "How much of the population identified as multiracial before the 2000s?", "id": "5ad29605d7d075001a429b06", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a social construct", "answer_start": 213}], "question": "What is race not acknowledged as?", "id": "5ad29605d7d075001a429b07", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "social justice", "answer_start": 440}], "question": "What did social movements from before the mid-twentieth century work to achieve?", "id": "5ad29605d7d075001a429b08", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The American people are mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various culturally distinct immigrant groups, many of which have now developed nations.
