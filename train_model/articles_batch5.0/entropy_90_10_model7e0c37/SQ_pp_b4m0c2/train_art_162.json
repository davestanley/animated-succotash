During the FTC probe , Nintendo changed the terms of its publisher licensing agreements to eliminate the two - year rule and other restrictive terms . Nintendo and the FTC settled the case in April 1991 , with Nintendo required to send vouchers giving a $ 5 discount off to a new game , to every person that had purchased a NES title between June 1988 and December 1990 . GameSpy remarked that Nintendo 's punishment was particularly weak giving the case 's findings , although it has been speculated that the FTC did not want to damage the video game industry in the United States .", "tags": "1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What was the first NES emulator?", "id": "571120ccb654c5140001fb9d", "answers": [{"text": "Pasofami", "answer_start": 109}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the first English available emulator?", "id": "571120ccb654c5140001fb9e", "answers": [{"text": "iNES", "answer_start": 143}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was NESticle released?", "id": "571120ccb654c5140001fb9f", "answers": [{"text": "April 3, 1997", "answer_start": 361}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What platform was NESticle available for use?", "id": "571120ccb654c5140001fba0", "answers": [{"text": "MS-DOS", "answer_start": 328}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Pasofami", "answer_start": 109}], "question": "What wasn't the first NES emulator?", "id": "5ad2abeed7d075001a429e7e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "iNES", "answer_start": 143}], "question": " What was the first Spanish available emulator?", "id": "5ad2abeed7d075001a429e7f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "April 3, 1997", "answer_start": 361}], "question": " When was NESticle halted?", "id": "5ad2abeed7d075001a429e80", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "MS-DOS", "answer_start": 328}], "question": " What platform was NESticle unavailable for use?", "id": "5ad2abeed7d075001a429e81", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The NES can be emulated on many other systems, most notably the PC.

By stark contrast , Nintendo 's marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and retailer confidence , by delivering a singular platform whose technology was not in need of heavy exaggeration and whose qualities were clearly defined .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "How much did the Deluxe NES sell for?", "id": "571123e4b654c5140001fbb7", "answers": [{"text": "US$199.99", "answer_start": 249}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much was the selling price equivalent to in today's money?", "id": "571123e4b654c5140001fbb8", "answers": [{"text": "$475", "answer_start": 274}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much did the console sell for bundled with just the Super Mario Bros. game?", "id": "571123e4b654c5140001fbb9", "answers": [{"text": "US$99.99", "answer_start": 457}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Super Mario Bros was paired with which game in the Action Set?", "id": "571123e4b654c5140001fbba", "answers": [{"text": "Duck Hunt", "answer_start": 671}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Basic Set sold for how much at release?", "id": "571123e4b654c5140001fbbb", "answers": [{"text": "US$89.99", "answer_start": 1364}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "$199.99", "answer_start": 251}], "question": " How much did the Deluxe SNES sell for?", "id": "5ad2a497d7d075001a429d8c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "$475", "answer_start": 274}], "question": " How much was the selling price equivalent to in 2018 money?", "id": "5ad2a497d7d075001a429d8d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "$99.99", "answer_start": 459}], "question": "How much did the console sell for bundled with just the Luigi Bros. game?", "id": "5ad2a497d7d075001a429d8e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Duck Hunt", "answer_start": 827}], "question": " Super Luigi Bros was paired with which game in the Action Set?", "id": "5ad2a497d7d075001a429d8f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "$89.99", "answer_start": 1366}], "question": " The Big Set sold for how much at release?", "id": "5ad2a497d7d075001a429d90", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "For its complete North American release, the Nintendo Entertainment System was progressively released over the ensuing years in four different bundles: the Deluxe Set, the Control Deck, the Action Set and the Power Set.

Since the new controllers do n't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console , certain games such as the Disk System version of The Legend of Zelda and Raid on Bungeling Bay will have certain tricks that can not be replicated when played on an HVC-101 Famicom without a modded controller . However , the HVC-101 Famicom is compatible with most NES controllers due to having the same controller port . Nintendo had also released a 3D graphic capable headset . However , this peripheral was never released outside Japan.[citation needed ]", "tags": "0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who developed Nintendo's PPU?", "id": "571126c6b654c5140001fbdd", "answers": [{"text": "Ricoh", "answer_start": 70}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many kb of Video RAM did the PPU have?", "id": "571126c6b654c5140001fbde", "answers": [{"text": "2", "answer_start": 111}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The system has how many colors available on it?", "id": "571126c6b654c5140001fbdf", "answers": [{"text": "48", "answer_start": 558}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many grays could be used as well?", "id": "571126c6b654c5140001fbe0", "answers": [{"text": "6", "answer_start": 572}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the standard display resolution of the NES?", "id": "571126c6b654c5140001fbe1", "answers": [{"text": "256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels", "answer_start": 954}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ricoh", "answer_start": 70}], "question": "Who developed Nintendo's SPU?", "id": "5ad2adc9d7d075001a429ee0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2", "answer_start": 367}], "question": " How many mb of Video RAM did the PPU have?", "id": "5ad2adc9d7d075001a429ee1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "48", "answer_start": 558}], "question": " The system didn't have how many colors available on it?", "id": "5ad2adc9d7d075001a429ee2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "6", "answer_start": 572}], "question": " How many blacks could be used as well?", "id": "5ad2adc9d7d075001a429ee3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels", "answer_start": 954}], "question": " What is not the standard display resolution of the NES?", "id": "5ad2adc9d7d075001a429ee4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The NES uses a custom-made Picture Processing Unit (PPU) developed by Ricoh.
