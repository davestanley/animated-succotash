These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth , including the production of other biomolecules . When an animal eats plants ( or eats other animals which have eaten plants ) , the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal . They are either used directly to help the animal grow , or broken down , releasing stored solar energy , and giving the animal the energy required for motion .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}]}, "version": ["v2.0"]}
