The charter went beyond simply addressing specific baronial complaints , and formed a wider proposal for political reform , albeit one focusing on the rights of free men , not serfs and unfree labour . It promised the protection of church rights , protection from illegal imprisonment , access to swift justice , new taxation only with baronial consent and limitations on scutage and other feudal payments . A council of twenty - five barons would be created to monitor and ensure John 's future adherence to the charter , whilst the rebel army would stand down and London would be surrendered to the king .", "tags": "1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "When did Prince Louis int to land in the south of England?", "id": "570c69eafed7b91900d459c5", "answers": [{"text": "May 1216", "answer_start": 57}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why did John hesitate to attack Louis?", "id": "570c69eafed7b91900d459c6", "answers": [{"text": "due to the risks of open battle", "answer_start": 283}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the rebels regain the south-east of England?", "id": "570c69eafed7b91900d459c7", "answers": [{"text": "end of the summer", "answer_start": 624}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Prince Louis intended to land in the south of England in May 1216, and John assembled a naval force to intercept him.
