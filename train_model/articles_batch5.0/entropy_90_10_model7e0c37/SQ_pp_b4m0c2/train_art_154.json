All three are radioactive , emitting alpha particles , with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission , rather than alpha emission . There are also five other trace isotopes : uranium-239 , which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission , releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom ; uranium-237 , which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more , which then decays to neptunium-237 ; uranium-233 , which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237 ; and finally , uranium-236 and -240 , which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244 . It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay , which would produce uranium-232 , but this has not yet been observed experimentally .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "About how many tonnes of uranium is theorized to be present in the sea?", "id": "570e36e30dc6ce1900204e7d", "answers": [{"text": "4.6 billion", "answer_start": 14}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The presence of what substance in sea water has resulted in low yields when attempting to extract uranium?", "id": "570e36e30dc6ce1900204e7e", "answers": [{"text": "carbonate", "answer_start": 309}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did ORNL call their material that performs surface retention on solid molecules?", "id": "570e36e30dc6ce1900204e7f", "answers": [{"text": "HiCap", "answer_start": 439}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where were ORNL's results verified?", "id": "570e36e30dc6ce1900204e80", "answers": [{"text": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "answer_start": 621}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was HiCap announced?", "id": "570e36e30dc6ce1900204e81", "answers": [{"text": "2012", "answer_start": 344}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "4.6 billion", "answer_start": 14}], "question": "About how many tonnes of uranium is theorized to be absent in the sea?", "id": "5ad11f4a645df0001a2d0e48", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "carbonate", "answer_start": 309}], "question": "The presence of what substance in fresh water has resulted in low yields when attempting to extract uranium?", "id": "5ad11f4a645df0001a2d0e49", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "HiCap", "answer_start": 439}], "question": "What did ORNL call their material that performs surface retention on liquid molecules?", "id": "5ad11f4a645df0001a2d0e4a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory", "answer_start": 621}], "question": "Where were ORNL's results unverified?", "id": "5ad11f4a645df0001a2d0e4b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2012", "answer_start": 344}], "question": "When wasn't HiCap announced?", "id": "5ad11f4a645df0001a2d0e4c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "An additional 4.6 billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible).

Yellow glass with 1 % uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples , Italy , by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912 . Starting in the late Middle Ages , pitchblende was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal , Bohemia ( now J\u00e1chymov in the Czech Republic ) , and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry . In the early 19th century , the world 's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What was the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction created by human beings called?", "id": "570e39580b85d914000d7d9f", "answers": [{"text": "Chicago Pile-1", "answer_start": 168}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "On what date was the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction created artificially?", "id": "570e39580b85d914000d7da0", "answers": [{"text": "2 December 1942", "answer_start": 3}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What project was Fermi working for?", "id": "570e39580b85d914000d7da1", "answers": [{"text": "Manhattan", "answer_start": 35}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "On the campus of what educational institution was Chicago Pile-1 created?", "id": "570e39580b85d914000d7da2", "answers": [{"text": "University of Chicago", "answer_start": 240}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many metric tons of uranium oxide was used in Chicago Pile-1?", "id": "570e39580b85d914000d7da3", "answers": [{"text": "53", "answer_start": 402}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Chicago Pile-1", "answer_start": 168}], "question": "What was the last self-sustained nuclear chain reaction created by human beings called?", "id": "5ad118da645df0001a2d0d50", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2 December 1942", "answer_start": 3}], "question": "On what date was the last self-sustained nuclear chain reaction created artificially?", "id": "5ad118da645df0001a2d0d51", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Manhattan Project", "answer_start": 35}], "question": "What project wasn't Fermi working for?", "id": "5ad118da645df0001a2d0d52", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "University of Chicago", "answer_start": 240}], "question": "On the campus of what educational institution was Chicago Pile-11 created?", "id": "5ad118da645df0001a2d0d53", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "53", "answer_start": 402}], "question": "How many metric tons of uranium oxide was used in Chicago Pile-21?", "id": "5ad118da645df0001a2d0d54", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "On 2 December 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, another team led by Enrico Fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1.
