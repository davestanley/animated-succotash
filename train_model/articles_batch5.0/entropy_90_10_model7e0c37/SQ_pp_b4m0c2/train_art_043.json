These included the prestigious ' Volta Laboratory Association ' ( 1880 ) , also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the ' Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory ' , and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau ( 1887 ) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown , Washington , D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery , and the very next year it improved Edison 's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it , key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted . The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his \" proudest achievement \" , \" the photophone \" , the \" optical telephone \" which presaged fibre optical telecommunications , while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing ( the AG Bell ) , a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness .", "tags": "0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What magazine did Bell found alongside Hubbard?", "id": "56dfc1cc7aa994140058e135", "answers": [{"text": "Science", "answer_start": 83}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Bell cease to be President of the National Geographic Society?", "id": "56dfc1cc7aa994140058e136", "answers": [{"text": "1903", "answer_start": 215}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What enduring feature of National Geographic did Bell help implement?", "id": "56dfc1cc7aa994140058e137", "answers": [{"text": "illustrations", "answer_start": 276}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What award did Bell win in 1902?", "id": "56dfc1cc7aa994140058e138", "answers": [{"text": "Albert Medal", "answer_start": 548}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In partnership with Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s.
