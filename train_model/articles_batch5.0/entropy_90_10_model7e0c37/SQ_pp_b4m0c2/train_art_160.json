Since the death penalty was reauthorized in 1976 , 1,411 people have been executed , almost exclusively by the states , with most occurring after 1990 . Texas has accounted for over one - third of modern executions ( although only two death sentences were imposed in Texas during 2015 , with the courts preferring to issue sentences of life without parole instead ) and over four times as many as Oklahoma , the state with the second - highest number . California has the greatest number of prisoners on death row , has issued the highest number of death sentences but has held relatively few executions .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In November 2008, who was on death penalty without a murder conviction?", "id": "570ff55ab654c5140001f6ef", "answers": [{"text": "Demarcus Sears", "answer_start": 123}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Demarcus Sears kidnap?", "id": "570ff55ab654c5140001f6f0", "answers": [{"text": "Gloria Ann Wilbur", "answer_start": 305}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what state was Gloria Ann Wilbur murdered?", "id": "570ff55ab654c5140001f6f1", "answers": [{"text": "Kentucky", "answer_start": 404}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year was Demarcus Sears convicted of kidnapping?", "id": "570ff55ab654c5140001f6f2", "answers": [{"text": "1986", "answer_start": 253}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "A jury in what state sentenced Demarcus Sears to death?", "id": "570ff55ab654c5140001f6f3", "answers": [{"text": "Georgia", "answer_start": 517}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Demarcus Sears", "answer_start": 123}], "question": "In November 2018, who was on death penalty without a murder conviction?", "id": "5ad3f56b604f3c001a3ff985", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gloria Ann Wilbur", "answer_start": 305}], "question": " Who did Demarcus Sears let go free?", "id": "5ad3f56b604f3c001a3ff986", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Kentucky", "answer_start": 404}], "question": " In what state was Gloria Ann Wilbur born?", "id": "5ad3f56b604f3c001a3ff987", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1986", "answer_start": 253}], "question": " In what year was Demarcus Sears freed of kidnapping?", "id": "5ad3f56b604f3c001a3ff988", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Georgia", "answer_start": 517}], "question": "A jury in what state sentenced Demarcus Sears to freedom?", "id": "5ad3f56b604f3c001a3ff989", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "As of November 2008, there is only one person on death row facing capital punishment who has not been convicted of murder.

The result of these two decisions means that the death penalty in the United States is largely restricted to cases where the defendant took the life of another human being . The current federal kidnapping statute , however , may be exempt because the death penalty applies if the victim dies in the perpetrator 's custody , not necessarily by his hand , thus stipulating a resulting death , which was the wording of the objection . In addition , the Federal government retains the death penalty for non - murder offenses that are considered crimes against the state , including treason , espionage , and crimes under military jurisdiction .", "tags": "0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what year was Nebraska's death penalty statute ruled unconstitutional by a state court?", "id": "57100c99a58dae1900cd6810", "answers": [{"text": "2008", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What state's court ruled capital punishment unconstitutional in 1984?", "id": "57100c99a58dae1900cd6811", "answers": [{"text": "Massachusetts", "answer_start": 82}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what case did the Kansas Supreme Court rule that the death penalty is unconstitutional in Kansas?", "id": "57100c99a58dae1900cd6812", "answers": [{"text": "State v.

According to the US Department of Justice , African Americans accounted for 52.5 % of homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008 , with whites 45.3 % and Native Americans and Asians 2.2 % . This means African Americans are less likely to be executed on a per capita basis . However , according to a 2003 Amnesty International report , blacks and whites were the victims of murder in almost equal numbers , yet 80 percent of the people executed since 1977 were convicted of murders involving white victims . 13.5 % of death row inmates are of Hispanic or Latino descent , while they make up 17.4 % of the general population .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In the United States, how many important steps are usually present in the administration of capital punishment?", "id": "571019eab654c5140001f7f1", "answers": [{"text": "four", "answer_start": 102}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with the President, what officeholder can issue pardons?", "id": "571019eab654c5140001f7f2", "answers": [{"text": "Governor", "answer_start": 379}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many death sentences were issued in the period 1995-1996?", "id": "571019eab654c5140001f7f3", "answers": [{"text": "309", "answer_start": 589}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many capital sentences were given in 1973?", "id": "571019eab654c5140001f7f4", "answers": [{"text": "44", "answer_start": 680}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year were there 73 death penalty convictions?", "id": "571019eab654c5140001f7f5", "answers": [{"text": "2014", "answer_start": 644}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "four", "answer_start": 102}], "question": "In the United States, how many important steps are never present in the administration of capital punishment?", "id": "5ad3f5e0604f3c001a3ff9bb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Governor", "answer_start": 379}], "question": " Along with the President, what officeholder can't issue pardons?", "id": "5ad3f5e0604f3c001a3ff9bc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "309", "answer_start": 589}], "question": "How many death sentences were rejected in the period 1995-1996?", "id": "5ad3f5e0604f3c001a3ff9bd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "44", "answer_start": 680}], "question": "How many capital sentences were rejected in 1973?", "id": "5ad3f5e0604f3c001a3ff9be", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2014", "answer_start": 644}], "question": " In what year were there 73 death penalty convictions overturned?", "id": "5ad3f5e0604f3c001a3ff9bf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The legal administration of the death penalty in the United States is complex.
