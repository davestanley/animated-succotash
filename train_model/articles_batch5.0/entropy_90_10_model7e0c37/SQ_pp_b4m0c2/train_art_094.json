Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals . Brazil has the largest population of Afro - descendants outside of Africa . In contrast to the US , during the slavery period and after , the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti - miscegenation or segregation laws . As in other Latin countries , intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward . In addition , people of mixed race ( pardo ) often tended to marry white , and their descendants became accepted as white . As a result , some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood . According to the last census of the 20th century , in which Brazilians could choose from five color / ethnic categories with which they identified , 54 % of individuals identified as white , 6.2 % identified as black , and 39.5 % identified as pardo ( brown ) \u2014 a broad multi - racial category , including tri - racial persons .", "tags": "0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "How much of the Brazilian population identified as black in 2000?", "id": "5707111d90286e26004fc89b", "answers": [{"text": "6.2%", "answer_start": 193}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much identified as mixed race?", "id": "5707111d90286e26004fc89c", "answers": [{"text": "40%", "answer_start": 237}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much identified as white?", "id": "5707111d90286e26004fc89d", "answers": [{"text": "55%", "answer_start": 255}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much of the Brazilian population had connections to African ancestry in 2007?", "id": "5707111d90286e26004fc89e", "answers": [{"text": "29%", "answer_start": 411}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "By the 2000 census, demographic changes including the end to slavery, immigration from Europe and Asia, assimilation of multiracial persons, and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2% of the population identified as black, 40% as pardo, and 55% as white.
