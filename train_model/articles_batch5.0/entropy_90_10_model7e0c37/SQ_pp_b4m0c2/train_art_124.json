The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires , referred to as a bolter , to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward . The angled deck allows the installation of one or two \" waist \" catapults in addition to the two bow cats . An angled deck also improves launch and recovery cycle flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where are ski-jump ramps located on aircraft carriers?", "id": "570aae5d4103511400d5991e", "answers": [{"text": "the forward end of the flight deck", "answer_start": 62}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did ski-jump ramps allow STOVL aircraft to do that they couldn't do with a flat deck??", "id": "570aae5d4103511400d5991f", "answers": [{"text": "take off at far higher weights", "answer_start": 153}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who originally developed the ski-jump ramp?", "id": "570aae5d4103511400d59920", "answers": [{"text": "the Royal Navy", "answer_start": 275}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does a ski-jump ramp convert in order to be successful?", "id": "570aae5d4103511400d59921", "answers": [{"text": "some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity", "answer_start": 390}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does the ski-jump ramp prevent a fully loaded and fueled aircraft from doing?", "id": "570aae5d4103511400d59922", "answers": [{"text": "either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea", "answer_start": 823}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "forward end of the flight deck", "answer_start": 66}], "question": "Where are snowboard-jump ramps located on aircraft carriers?", "id": "5acd830507355d001abf44f0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "take off at far higher weights", "answer_start": 153}], "question": "What did ski-jump ramps stop STOVL aircraft to do that they couldn't do with a flat deck?", "id": "5acd830507355d001abf44f1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Royal Navy", "answer_start": 275}], "question": "Who originally hated the ski-jump ramp?", "id": "5acd830507355d001abf44f2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity", "answer_start": 390}], "question": "What does a ski-jump ramp convert in order to be a failure?", "id": "5acd830507355d001abf44f3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea", "answer_start": 823}], "question": "What does the ski-jump ramp prevent a unloaded and fueled aircraft from doing?", "id": "5acd830507355d001abf44f4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck.

The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers . Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about , as no other nation had fielded anything comparable . However , the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun - range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940 .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What develpment produced the first large fleet ships?", "id": "570ac9296d058f19001830f6", "answers": [{"text": "flattop vessels", "answer_start": 19}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the world's first carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft?", "id": "570ac9296d058f19001830f7", "answers": [{"text": "HMS Argus", "answer_start": 82}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limit?", "id": "570ac9296d058f19001830f8", "answers": [{"text": "the construction of new heavy surface combat ships", "answer_start": 243}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What caused early aircraft carriers to be made up of conversions of ships that were previously cargo ships, cruisers or battlecruisers?", "id": "570ac9296d058f19001830f9", "answers": [{"text": "Washington Naval Treaty of 1922", "answer_start": 196}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of aircraft carriers did these ship conversions give rise to in 1927?", "id": "570ac9296d058f19001830fa", "answers": [{"text": "Lexington-class", "answer_start": 501}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "flattop vessels", "answer_start": 19}], "question": "What develpment produced the first small fleet ships?", "id": "5acd6fb407355d001abf4222", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "HMS Argus", "answer_start": 82}], "question": "What was the world's first carrier capable of launching and recovering civilian aircraft?", "id": "5acd6fb407355d001abf4223", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the construction of new heavy surface combat ships", "answer_start": 243}], "question": "What did the Washington Naval Treaty of 1920 limit?", "id": "5acd6fb407355d001abf4224", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Washington Naval Treaty of 1922", "answer_start": 196}], "question": "What caused modern aircraft carriers to be made up of conversions of ships that were previously cargo ships, cruisers or battlecruisers?", "id": "5acd6fb407355d001abf4225", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Lexington-class", "answer_start": 501}], "question": "What type of aircraft carriers did these ship conversions give rise to in 1972?", "id": "5acd6fb407355d001abf4226", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships.
