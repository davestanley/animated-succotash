Matter can be argued to be redundant , as in bundle theory , and mind - independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective percepts . Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter , as there is no direct experience of matter ; all that is experienced is perception , whether internal or external . As such , the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent ( perceived ) stability of perceptions ; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience .", "tags": "0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What 3 types of philosophies attempt to correct the problem with matter and energy without removing every belief about materialism?", "id": "56deef443277331400b4d82e", "answers": [{"text": "Emergence, holism, and process philosophy", "answer_start": 125}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "matter and energy", "answer_start": 3}], "question": "What is unnecessary to explain the physical world?
