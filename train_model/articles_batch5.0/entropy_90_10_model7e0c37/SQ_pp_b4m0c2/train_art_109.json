Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination , i.e. , why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their \" in - group \" over those considered to be outsiders . Both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition . For example , in work relating to social identity theory it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out - groups can lead to subtle effects on people 's evaluations of others ( Cote & Levine 2002 ) .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What approach takes the sense of self and belonging as a fixed thing?", "id": "57097200200fba140036800d", "answers": [{"text": "a primordialist approach", "answer_start": 18}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The view that identity is based on a political choice of characteristics is rooted in what theory?", "id": "57097200200fba140036800e", "answers": [{"text": "social constructionist theory", "answer_start": 242}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Primordialist and social constructionist views need to be understood in what contexts?", "id": "57097200200fba1400368010", "answers": [{"text": "political and historical contexts", "answer_start": 558}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "primordialist approach", "answer_start": 20}], "question": "What approach takes the sense of self and as a changing thing?", "id": "5a149ddea54d4200185292a7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "social constructionist theory", "answer_start": 242}], "question": "What theory says that political choice is based on identity characteristics?", "id": "5a149ddea54d4200185292a8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "identity", "answer_start": 293}], "question": "What influences primordalist and social constructionist views", "id": "5a149ddea54d4200185292a9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "political and historical contexts", "answer_start": 558}], "question": "primordalist and social constructionist views need to be viewed outside of what?", "id": "5a149ddea54d4200185292aa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "approaches to the conceptualisation of identity", "answer_start": 729}], "question": "What have primordalist and social constructionist views stopped exerting influence on?", "id": "5a149ddea54d4200185292ab", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and belonging to a collective group as a fixed thing, defined by objective criteria such as common ancestry and common biological characteristics.

Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are ' identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is identified as determining how a person views him or herself to a significant degree?", "id": "57097db3ed30961900e8420c", "answers": [{"text": "Gender identity", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are racial, religious, ethnic, and occupational aspects aspects of?", "id": "57097db3ed30961900e8420d", "answers": [{"text": "identity", "answer_start": 213}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Identity refers to the capacity for self-reflection and awareness in what scientific study?", "id": "57097db3ed30961900e8420e", "answers": [{"text": "cognitive psychology", "answer_start": 410}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gender identity", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What type of identity is less important in psychology?", "id": "5a14558cc8eab200188dca27", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gender identity", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What what does not dictate to a significant degree how one views oneself?", "id": "5a14558cc8eab200188dca28", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "racial, religious, ethnic, occupational", "answer_start": 231}], "question": "What other aspects of identity are more important than gender?", "id": "5a14558cc8eab200188dca29", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "identity", "answer_start": 442}], "question": "What refers to capacity for self reflection and awareness of others?", "id": "5a14558cc8eab200188dca2a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Gender identity forms an important part of identity in psychology, as it dictates to a significant degree how one views oneself both as a person and in relation to other people, ideas and nature.
