In//0 most//0 systems//0 ,//0 the//0 prime//0 minister//0 is//0 the//0 presiding//0 member//0 and//0 chairman//0 of//0 the//0 cabinet//1 .//0 
In//0 a//0 minority//0 of//0 systems//0 ,//0 notably//0 in//0 semi//0 -//0 presidential//0 systems//0 of//0 government//0 ,//0 a//0 prime//0 minister//0 is//0 the//0 official//0 who//0 is//0 appointed//0 to//0 manage//0 the//0 civil//1 service//1 and//0 execute//0 the//0 directives//0 of//0 the//0 head//0 of//0 state//0 .//0 
In//0 parliamentary//0 systems//0 fashioned//0 after//0 the//0 Westminster//1 system//1 ,//0 the//0 prime//0 minister//0 is//0 the//0 presiding//0 and//0 actual//0 head//0 of//0 government//0 and//0 head//0 of//0 the//0 executive//0 branch//0 .//0

In//0 some//0 monarchies//0 the//0 monarch//0 may//0 also//0 exercise//0 executive//0 powers//0 (//0 known//0 as//0 the//0 royal//1 prerogative//1 )//0 that//0 are//0 constitutionally//0 vested//0 in//0 the//0 crown//0 and//0 may//0 be//0 exercised//0 without//0 the//0 approval//0 of//0 parliament//1 .//0

The//0 first//0 actual//0 usage//0 of//0 the//0 term//0 prime//0 minister//0 or//0 Premier//0 Ministre[citation//0 needed//0 ]//0 was//0 used//0 by//0 Cardinal//1 Richelieu//1 when//0 in//0 1625//1 he//0 was//0 named//0 to//0 head//0 the//0 royal//0 council//0 as//0 prime//0 minister//0 of//0 France//1 .//0 
Louis//1 XIV//1 and//0 his//0 descendants//0 generally//0 attempted//0 to//0 avoid//0 giving//0 this//0 title//0 to//0 their//0 chief//0 ministers//0 .//0 
The//0 term//0 prime//0 minister//0 in//0 the//0 sense//0 that//0 we//0 know//0 it//0 originated//0 in//0 the//0 18th//1 century//1 in//0 the//0 United//0 Kingdom//0 when//0 members//0 of//0 parliament//0 disparagingly//0 used//0 the//0 title//0 in//0 reference//0 to//0 Sir//0 Robert//0 Walpole//0 .//0 
Over//0 time//0 ,//0 the//0 title//0 became//0 honorific//0 and//0 remains//0 so//0 in//0 the//0 21st//0 century//1 .//0 
The//0 monarchs//0 of//0 England//0 and//0 the//0 United//0 Kingdom//0 had//0 ministers//0 in//0 whom//0 they//0 placed//0 special//0 trust//0 and//0 who//0 were//0 regarded//0 as//0 the//0 head//0 of//0 the//0 government//0 .//0 
Examples//0 were//0 Thomas//1 Cromwell//1 under//0 Henry//0 VIII//0 ;//0 William//0 Cecil//0 ,//0 Lord//0 Burghley//0 under//0 Elizabeth//0 I//0 ;//0 Clarendon//1 under//0 Charles//0 II//0 and//0 Godolphin//1 under//0 Queen//0 Anne//0 .//0 
These//0 ministers//0 held//0 a//0 variety//0 of//0 formal//0 posts//0 ,//0 but//0 were//0 commonly//0 known//0 as//0 "//0 the//0 minister//0 "//0 ,//0 the//0 "//0 chief//0 minister//0 "//0 ,//0 the//0 "//0 first//0 minister//0 "//0 and//0 finally//0 the//0 "//0 prime//0 minister//0 "//0 .//0 
The//0 power//0 of//0 these//0 ministers//0 depended//0 entirely//0 on//0 the//0 personal//0 favour//0 of//0 the//0 monarch//1 .//0 
Although//0 managing//0 the//0 parliament//0 was//0 among//0 the//0 necessary//0 skills//0 of//0 holding//0 high//0 office//0 ,//0 they//0 did//0 not//0 depend//0 on//0 a//0 parliamentary//0 majority//0 for//0 their//0 power//0 .//0 
Although//0 there//0 was//0 a//0 cabinet//0 ,//0 it//0 was//0 appointed//0 entirely//0 by//0 the//0 monarch//1 ,//0 and//0 the//0 monarch//1 usually//0 presided//0 over//0 its//0 meetings//0 .//0 
When//0 the//0 monarch//0 grew//0 tired//0 of//0 a//0 first//0 minister//0 ,//0 he//0 or//0 she//0 could//0 be//0 dismissed//0 ,//0 or//0 worse//0 ://0 Cromwell//0 was//0 executed//0 and//0 Clarendon//1 driven//0 into//0 exile//0 when//0 they//0 lost//0 favour//0 .//0 
Kings//0 sometimes//0 divided//0 power//0 equally//0 between//0 two//0 or//0 more//0 ministers//0 to//0 prevent//0 one//0 minister//0 from//0 becoming//0 too//0 powerful//0 .//0 
Late//0 in//0 Anne//0 's//0 reign//0 ,//0 for//0 example//0 ,//0 the//0 Tory//0 ministers//0 Harley//0 and//0 St//0 John//0 shared//0 power//0 .//0 
In//0 the//0 mid//0 17th//0 century//0 ,//0 after//0 the//0 English//0 Civil//0 War//0 (//0 1642–1651//0 )//0 ,//0 Parliament//0 strengthened//0 its//0 position//0 relative//0 to//0 the//0 monarch//0 then//0 gained//0 more//0 power//0 through//0 the//0 Glorious//1 Revolution//1 of//0 1688//0 and//0 passage//0 of//0 the//0 Bill//1 of//0 Rights//1 in//0 1689//0 .//0 
The//0 monarch//0 could//0 no//0 longer//0 establish//0 any//0 law//0 or//0 impose//0 any//0 tax//0 without//0 its//0 permission//0 and//0 thus//0 the//0 House//1 of//0 Commons//1 became//0 a//0 part//0 of//0 the//0 government//0 .//0 
It//0 is//0 at//0 this//0 point//0 that//0 a//0 modern//0 style//0 of//0 prime//0 minister//0 begins//0 to//0 emerge//0 .//0 
A//0 tipping//0 point//0 in//0 the//0 evolution//0 of//0 the//0 prime//0 ministership//0 came//0 with//0 the//0 death//0 of//0 Anne//0 in//0 1714//1 and//0 the//0 accession//0 of//0 George//1 I//1 to//0 the//0 throne//0 .//0 
George//1 spoke//0 no//0 English//0 ,//0 spent//0 much//0 of//0 his//0 time//0 at//0 his//0 home//0 in//0 Hanover//1 ,//0 and//0 had//0 neither//0 knowledge//0 of//0 ,//0 nor//0 interest//0 in//0 ,//0 the//0 details//0 of//0 English//0 government//0 .//0 
In//0 these//0 circumstances//0 it//0 was//0 inevitable//0 that//0 the//0 king//0 's//0 first//0 minister//0 would//0 become//0 the//0 de//0 facto//0 head//0 of//0 the//0 government//0 .//0 
From//0 1721//0 this//0 was//0 the//0 Whig//1 politician//0 Robert//0 Walpole//0 ,//0 who//0 held//0 office//0 for//0 twenty//0 -//0 one//0 years//1 .//0 
Walpole//0 chaired//0 cabinet//0 meetings//0 ,//0 appointed//0 all//0 the//0 other//0 ministers//0 ,//0 dispensed//0 the//0 royal//0 patronage//0 and//0 packed//0 the//0 House//0 of//0 Commons//0 with//0 his//0 supporters//0 .//0 
Under//0 Walpole//0 ,//0 the//0 doctrine//0 of//0 cabinet//0 solidarity//0 developed//0 .//0 
Walpole//0 required//0 that//0 no//0 minister//0 other//0 than//0 himself//0 have//0 private//0 dealings//0 with//0 the//0 king//0 ,//0 and//0 also//0 that//0 when//0 the//0 cabinet//0 had//0 agreed//0 on//0 a//0 policy//0 ,//0 all//0 ministers//0 must//0 defend//0 it//0 in//0 public//0 ,//0 or//0 resign//1 .//0

Walpole//0 always//0 denied//0 that//0 he//0 was//0 "//0 prime//0 minister//0 "//0 ,//0 and//0 throughout//0 the//0 18th//0 century//0 parliamentarians//0 and//0 legal//0 scholars//0 continued//0 to//0 deny//0 that//0 any//0 such//0 position//0 was//0 known//0 to//0 the//0 Constitution//0 .//0 
George//0 II//0 and//0 George//0 III//0 made//0 strenuous//0 efforts//0 to//0 reclaim//0 the//0 personal//0 power//0 of//0 the//0 monarch//0 ,//0 but//0 the//0 increasing//0 complexity//0 and//0 expense//0 of//0 government//0 meant//0 that//0 a//0 minister//0 who//0 could//0 command//0 the//0 loyalty//0 of//0 the//0 Commons//0 was//0 increasingly//0 necessary//0 .//0 
The//0 long//0 tenure//0 of//0 the//0 wartime//0 prime//0 minister//0 William//0 Pitt//0 the//0 Younger//0 (//0 1783–1801//0 )//0 ,//0 combined//0 with//0 the//0 mental//0 illness//0 of//0 George//0 III//0 ,//0 consolidated//0 the//0 power//0 of//0 the//0 post//0 .//0
