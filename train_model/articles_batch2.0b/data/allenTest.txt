Neoclassical//1 economics//1 views//0 inequalities//0 in//0 the//0 distribution//0 of//0 income//0 as//0 arising//0 from//0 differences//1 in//0 value//1 added//1 by//0 labor//0 ,//0 capital//0 and//0 land//0 .//0 
Within//0 labor//0 income//0 distribution//0 is//0 due//0 to//0 differences//1 in//0 value//1 added//1 by//0 different//0 classifications//0 of//0 workers//0 .//0 
In//0 this//0 perspective//0 ,//0 wages//1 and//0 profits//1 are//0 determined//0 by//0 the//0 marginal//0 value//1 added//1 of//0 each//0 economic//0 actor//0 (//0 worker//0 ,//0 capitalist//0 ///0 business//0 owner//0 ,//0 landlord//0 )//0 .//0 
Thus//0 ,//0 in//0 a//0 market//0 economy//0 ,//0 inequality//0 is//0 a//0 reflection//0 of//0 the//0 productivity//1 gap//1 between//0 highly//0 -//0 paid//0 professions//0 and//0 lower//0 -//0 paid//0 professions//0 .//0 
In//0 Marxian//0 analysis//0 ,//0 capitalist//0 firms//0 increasingly//0 substitute//0 capital//0 equipment//0 for//0 labor//1 inputs//1 (//0 workers//0 )//0 under//0 competitive//0 pressure//0 to//0 reduce//0 costs//0 and//0 maximize//0 profits//0 .//0 
Over//0 the//0 long//0 -//0 term//0 ,//0 this//0 trend//0 increases//0 the//0 organic//0 composition//0 of//0 capital//0 ,//0 meaning//0 that//0 less//0 workers//0 are//0 required//0 in//0 proportion//0 to//0 capital//0 inputs//1 ,//0 increasing//1 unemployment//1 (//0 the//0 "//0 reserve//0 army//0 of//0 labour//0 "//0 )//0 .//0 
This//0 process//0 exerts//0 a//0 downward//0 pressure//0 on//0 wages//1 .//0 
The//0 substitution//0 of//0 capital//0 equipment//0 for//0 labor//1 (//0 mechanization//0 and//0 automation//0 )//0 raises//0 the//0 productivity//1 of//0 each//0 worker//0 ,//0 resulting//0 in//0 a//0 situation//0 of//0 relatively//0 stagnant//1 wages//1 for//0 the//0 working//0 class//0 amidst//0 rising//0 levels//0 of//0 property//0 income//0 for//0 the//0 capitalist//0 class//0 .//0 
In//0 a//0 purely//0 capitalist//0 mode//0 of//0 production//0 (//0 i.e.//0 where//0 professional//0 and//0 labor//0 organizations//0 can//0 not//0 limit//0 the//0 number//0 of//0 workers//1 )//0 the//0 workers//1 wages//1 will//0 not//0 be//0 controlled//0 by//0 these//0 organizations//0 ,//0 or//0 by//0 the//0 employer//0 ,//0 but//0 rather//0 by//0 the//0 market//1 .//0 
Wages//1 work//0 in//0 the//0 same//0 way//0 as//0 prices//1 for//0 any//0 other//0 good//0 .//0 
Thus//0 ,//0 wages//1 can//0 be//0 considered//0 as//0 a//0 function//0 of//0 market//1 price//0 of//0 skill//0 .//0 
And//0 therefore//0 ,//0 inequality//0 is//0 driven//0 by//0 this//0 price//0 .//0 
Under//0 the//0 law//0 of//0 supply//1 and//0 demand//1 ,//0 the//0 price//0 of//0 skill//0 is//0 determined//0 by//0 a//0 race//0 between//0 the//0 demand//1 for//0 the//0 skilled//0 worker//0 and//0 the//0 supply//1 of//0 the//0 skilled//0 worker//0 .//0 
"//0 On//0 the//0 other//0 hand//0 ,//0 markets//1 can//0 also//0 concentrate//0 wealth//0 ,//0 pass//0 environmental//0 costs//0 on//0 to//0 society//0 ,//0 and//0 abuse//0 workers//1 and//0 consumers//0 .//0 
"//0 "//0 Markets//1 ,//0 by//0 themselves//0 ,//0 even//0 when//0 they//0 are//0 stable//0 ,//0 often//0 lead//0 to//0 high//0 levels//0 of//0 inequality//0 ,//0 outcomes//0 that//0 are//0 widely//0 viewed//0 as//0 unfair//1 .//0 
"//0 Employers//0 who//0 offer//0 a//0 below//0 market//1 wage//0 will//0 find//0 that//0 their//0 business//0 is//0 chronically//1 understaffed//1 .//0 
Their//0 competitors//0 will//0 take//0 advantage//0 of//0 the//0 situation//0 by//0 offering//0 a//0 higher//0 wage//0 the//0 best//0 of//0 their//0 labor//0 .//0 
For//0 a//0 businessman//0 who//0 has//0 the//0 profit//0 motive//0 as//0 the//0 prime//0 interest//0 ,//0 it//0 is//0 a//0 losing//0 proposition//0 to//0 offer//0 below//0 or//0 above//0 market//1 wages//1 to//0 workers//1 .//0 
A//0 job//0 where//0 there//0 are//0 many//0 workers//1 willing//0 to//0 work//0 a//0 large//0 amount//0 of//0 time//0 (//0 high//1 supply//1 )//0 competing//0 for//0 a//0 job//0 that//0 few//0 require//0 (//0 low//1 demand//1 )//0 will//0 result//0 in//0 a//0 low//1 wage//1 for//0 that//0 job//0 .//0 
This//0 is//0 because//0 competition//1 between//0 workers//1 drives//0 down//0 the//0 wage//1 .//0 
An//0 example//0 of//0 this//0 would//0 be//0 jobs//0 such//0 as//0 dish//0 -//0 washing//0 or//0 customer//0 service//0 .//0 
Competition//1 amongst//0 workers//1 tends//0 to//0 drive//0 down//0 wages//1 due//0 to//0 the//0 expendable//0 nature//0 of//0 the//0 worker//0 in//0 relation//0 to//0 his//0 or//0 her//0 particular//0 job//0 .//0 
A//0 job//0 where//0 there//0 are//0 few//0 able//0 or//0 willing//0 workers//1 (//0 low//1 supply//1 )//0 ,//0 but//0 a//0 large//0 need//0 for//0 the//0 positions//0 (//0 high//1 demand//1 )//0 ,//0 will//0 result//0 in//0 high//1 wages//1 for//0 that//0 job//0 .//0 
This//0 is//0 because//0 competition//1 between//0 employers//1 for//0 employees//0 will//0 drive//0 up//0 the//0 wage//1 .//0 
Examples//0 of//0 this//0 would//0 include//0 jobs//0 that//0 require//0 highly//0 developed//0 skills//0 ,//0 rare//0 abilities//0 ,//0 or//0 a//0 high//1 level//0 of//0 risk//0 .//0 
Competition//1 amongst//0 employers//1 tends//0 to//0 drive//0 up//0 wages//1 due//0 to//0 the//0 nature//0 of//0 the//0 job//0 ,//0 since//0 there//0 is//0 a//0 relative//0 shortage//0 of//0 workers//1 for//0 the//0 particular//0 position//0 .//0 
Professional//0 and//0 labor//0 organizations//0 may//0 limit//0 the//0 supply//1 of//0 workers//1 which//0 results//0 in//0 higher//0 demand//1 and//0 greater//0 incomes//0 for//0 members//0 .//0 
Members//0 may//0 also//0 receive//0 higher//0 wages//1 through//0 collective//0 bargaining//0 ,//0 political//0 influence//0 ,//0 or//0 corruption//0 .//0 
On//0 the//0 other//0 hand//0 ,//0 higher//0 economic//0 inequality//0 tends//0 to//0 increase//0 entrepreneurship//1 rates//1 at//0 the//0 individual//0 level//0 (//0 self//0 -//0 employment//0 )//0 .//0 
However//0 ,//0 most//0 of//0 it//0 is//0 often//0 based//0 on//0 necessity//1 rather//0 than//0 opportunity//0 .//0 
Necessity//1 -//0 based//0 entrepreneurship//1 is//0 motivated//0 by//0 survival//0 needs//0 such//0 as//0 income//0 for//0 food//0 and//0 shelter//0 (//0 "//0 push//1 "//0 motivations//1 )//0 ,//0 whereas//0 opportunity//0 -//0 based//0 entrepreneurship//1 is//0 driven//0 by//0 achievement//0 -//0 oriented//0 motivations//1 (//0 "//0 pull//1 "//0 )//0 such//0 as//0 vocation//0 and//0 more//0 likely//0 to//0 involve//0 the//0 pursue//0 of//0 new//0 products//0 ,//0 services//0 ,//0 or//0 underserved//0 market//0 needs//0 .//0 
The//0 economic//0 impact//0 of//0 the//0 former//0 type//0 of//0 entrepreneurialism//0 tends//0 to//0 be//0 redistributive//0 while//0 the//0 latter//0 is//0 expected//0 to//0 foster//0 technological//0 progress//0 and//0 thus//0 have//0 a//0 more//0 positive//1 impact//0 on//0 economic//0 growth//0 .//0 
Another//0 cause//0 is//0 the//0 rate//1 at//0 which//0 income//0 is//0 taxed//0 coupled//0 with//0 the//0 progressivity//0 of//0 the//0 tax//1 system//1 .//0 
A//0 progressive//1 tax//1 is//0 a//0 tax//1 by//0 which//0 the//0 tax//1 rate//1 increases//0 as//0 the//0 taxable//0 base//0 amount//0 increases//0 .//0 
In//0 a//0 progressive//1 tax//1 system//1 ,//0 the//0 level//0 of//0 the//0 top//1 tax//1 rate//1 will//0 often//0 have//0 a//0 direct//0 impact//0 on//0 the//0 level//0 of//0 inequality//0 within//0 a//0 society//0 ,//0 either//0 increasing//0 it//0 or//0 decreasing//0 it//0 ,//0 provided//0 that//0 income//0 does//0 not//0 change//0 as//0 a//0 result//0 of//0 the//0 change//0 in//0 tax//1 regime//0 .//0 
Additionally//0 ,//0 steeper//1 tax//1 progressivity//0 applied//0 to//0 social//1 spending//1 can//0 result//0 in//0 a//0 more//0 equal//0 distribution//0 of//0 income//0 across//0 the//0 board//0 .//0 
The//0 difference//0 between//0 the//0 Gini//1 index//1 for//0 an//0 income//0 distribution//0 before//0 taxation//0 and//0 the//0 Gini//1 index//1 after//0 taxation//0 is//0 an//0 indicator//0 for//0 the//0 effects//0 of//0 such//0 taxation//0 .//0 
An//0 important//0 factor//0 in//0 the//0 creation//0 of//0 inequality//0 is//0 variation//0 in//0 individuals//0 '//0 access//1 to//0 education//1 .//0 
Education//1 ,//0 especially//0 in//0 an//0 area//0 where//0 there//0 is//0 a//0 high//1 demand//0 for//0 workers//0 ,//0 creates//0 high//1 wages//1 for//0 those//0 with//0 this//0 education//1 ,//0 however//0 ,//0 increases//0 in//0 education//1 first//0 increase//0 and//0 then//0 decrease//0 growth//0 as//0 well//0 as//0 income//0 inequality//0 .//0 
As//0 a//0 result//0 ,//0 those//0 who//0 are//0 unable//0 to//0 afford//0 an//0 education//1 ,//0 or//0 choose//0 not//0 to//0 pursue//0 optional//1 education//1 ,//0 generally//0 receive//0 much//0 lower//1 wages//1 .//0 
The//0 justification//0 for//0 this//0 is//0 that//0 a//0 lack//0 of//0 education//1 leads//0 directly//0 to//0 lower//1 incomes//1 ,//0 and//0 thus//0 lower//1 aggregate//0 savings//1 and//0 investment//1 .//0 
Conversely//0 ,//0 education//1 raises//0 incomes//1 and//0 promotes//0 growth//0 because//0 it//0 helps//0 to//0 unleash//0 the//0 productive//0 potential//0 of//0 the//0 poor//1 .//0 
In//0 2014//1 ,//0 economists//0 with//0 the//0 Standard//0 &//0 Poor//0 's//0 rating//0 agency//0 concluded//0 that//0 the//0 widening//0 disparity//0 between//0 the//0 U.S.//0 's//0 wealthiest//0 citizens//0 and//0 the//0 rest//0 of//0 the//0 nation//0 had//0 slowed//0 its//0 recovery//0 from//0 the//0 2008//0 -//0 2009//0 recession//0 and//0 made//0 it//0 more//0 prone//0 to//0 boom//0 -//0 and//0 -//0 bust//0 cycles//1 .//0

During//0 the//0 mass//0 high//0 school//0 education//1 movement//0 from//0 1910–1940//1 ,//0 there//0 was//0 an//0 increase//1 in//0 skilled//0 workers//0 ,//0 which//0 led//0 to//0 a//0 decrease//1 in//0 the//0 price//0 of//0 skilled//0 labor//0 .//0

In//0 HIV//1 ,//0 the//0 envelope//0 that//0 covers//0 the//0 virion//0 is//0 formed//0 from//0 the//0 outermost//0 membrane//0 of//0 the//0 host//0 cell//0 ;//0 such//0 "//0 self//0 -//0 cloaked//0 "//0 viruses//0 make//0 it//0 difficult//0 for//0 the//0 immune//0 system//0 to//0 identify//0 them//0 as//0 "//0 non//0 -//0 self//0 "//0 structures//0 .//0 
Another//0 important//0 role//0 of//0 the//0 immune//1 system//0 is//0 to//0 identify//0 and//0 eliminate//0 tumors//0 .//0 
This//0 is//0 called//0 immune//1 surveillance//1 .//0 
The//0 transformed//0 cells//0 of//0 tumors//0 express//0 antigens//0 that//0 are//0 not//0 found//0 on//0 normal//0 cells//0 .//0 
To//0 the//0 immune//1 system//0 ,//0 these//0 antigens//0 appear//0 foreign//0 ,//0 and//0 their//0 presence//0 causes//0 immune//1 cells//0 to//0 attack//0 the//0 transformed//0 tumor//0 cells//0 .//0 
The//0 antigens//0 expressed//0 by//0 tumors//0 have//0 several//0 sources//0 ;//0 some//0 are//0 derived//0 from//0 oncogenic//0 viruses//0 like//0 human//1 papillomavirus//1 ,//0 which//0 causes//0 cervical//0 cancer//0 ,//0 while//0 others//0 are//0 the//0 organism//0 's//0 own//0 proteins//0 that//0 occur//0 at//0 low//0 levels//0 in//0 normal//0 cells//0 but//0 reach//0 high//0 levels//0 in//0 tumor//0 cells//0 .//0

The//0 most//0 basic//0 method//0 of//0 checking//0 the//0 primality//0 of//0 a//0 given//0 integer//0 n//0 is//0 called//0 trial//1 division//1 .//0 
This//0 routine//0 consists//0 of//0 dividing//0 n//0 by//0 each//0 integer//0 m//0 that//0 is//0 greater//1 than//0 1//1 and//0 less//0 than//0 or//0 equal//0 to//0 the//0 square//0 root//0 of//0 n.//0 If//0 the//0 result//0 of//0 any//0 of//0 these//0 divisions//1 is//0 an//0 integer//0 ,//0 then//0 n//0 is//0 not//0 a//0 prime//1 ,//0 otherwise//0 it//0 is//0 a//0 prime//1 .//0 
Indeed//0 ,//0 if//0 is//0 composite//0 (//0 with//0 a//0 and//0 b//0 ≠//0 1//1 )//0 then//0 one//0 of//0 the//0 factors//0 a//0 or//0 b//0 is//0 necessarily//0 at//0 most//0 .//0 
For//0 example//0 ,//0 for//0 ,//0 the//0 trial//1 divisions//1 are//0 by//0 m//0 =//0 2//0 ,//0 3//0 ,//0 4//0 ,//0 5//0 ,//0 and//0 6//0 .//0 
None//0 of//0 these//0 numbers//0 divides//0 37//0 ,//0 so//0 37//0 is//0 prime//1 .//0 
This//0 routine//0 can//0 be//0 implemented//0 more//0 efficiently//0 if//0 a//0 complete//0 list//0 of//0 primes//0 up//0 to//0 is//0 known//0 —//0 then//0 trial//1 divisions//1 need//0 to//0 be//0 checked//0 only//0 for//0 those//0 m//0 that//0 are//0 prime//1 .//0 
For//0 example//0 ,//0 to//0 check//0 the//0 primality//0 of//0 37//0 ,//0 only//0 three//1 divisions//1 are//0 necessary//0 (//0 m//0 =//0 2//0 ,//0 3//0 ,//0 and//0 5//0 )//0 ,//0 given//0 that//0 4//0 and//0 6//0 are//0 composite//0 .//0 
Modern//0 primality//0 tests//0 for//0 general//0 numbers//0 n//0 can//0 be//0 divided//0 into//0 two//1 main//0 classes//0 ,//0 probabilistic//1 (//0 or//0 "//0 Monte//0 Carlo//0 "//0 )//0 and//0 deterministic//1 algorithms//1 .//0 
Deterministic//1 algorithms//1 provide//0 a//0 way//0 to//0 tell//0 for//0 sure//0 whether//0 a//0 given//0 number//0 is//0 prime//0 or//0 not//0 .//0 
For//0 example//0 ,//0 trial//0 division//0 is//0 a//0 deterministic//1 algorithm//1 because//0 ,//0 if//0 performed//0 correctly//0 ,//0 it//0 will//0 always//0 identify//0 a//0 prime//0 number//0 as//0 prime//0 and//0 a//0 composite//0 number//0 as//0 composite//0 .//0 
Probabilistic//1 algorithms//1 are//0 normally//0 faster//0 ,//0 but//0 do//0 not//0 completely//0 prove//0 that//0 a//0 number//0 is//0 prime//0 .//0 
These//0 tests//0 rely//0 on//0 testing//0 a//0 given//0 number//0 in//0 a//0 partly//0 random//0 way//0 .//0 
For//0 example//0 ,//0 a//0 given//0 test//0 might//0 pass//0 all//0 the//0 time//0 if//0 applied//0 to//0 a//0 prime//0 number//0 ,//0 but//0 pass//0 only//0 with//0 probability//0 p//0 if//0 applied//0 to//0 a//0 composite//0 number//0 .//0 
If//0 we//0 repeat//0 the//0 test//0 n//0 times//0 and//0 pass//0 every//0 time//0 ,//0 then//0 the//0 probability//0 that//0 our//0 number//0 is//0 composite//0 is//0 1/(1-p)n//1 ,//0 which//0 decreases//0 exponentially//0 with//0 the//0 number//0 of//0 tests//0 ,//0 so//0 we//0 can//0 be//0 as//0 sure//0 as//0 we//0 like//0 (//0 though//0 never//0 perfectly//0 sure//0 )//0 that//0 the//0 number//0 is//0 prime//0 .//0 
On//0 the//0 other//0 hand//0 ,//0 if//0 the//0 test//0 ever//0 fails//0 ,//0 then//0 we//0 know//0 that//0 the//0 number//0 is//0 composite//0 .//0 
A//0 particularly//0 simple//0 example//0 of//0 a//0 probabilistic//0 test//0 is//0 the//0 Fermat//0 primality//0 test//0 ,//0 which//0 relies//0 on//0 the//0 fact//0 (//0 Fermat//0 's//0 little//0 theorem//0 )//0 that//0 np≡n//0 (//0 mod//0 p//0 )//0 for//0 any//0 n//0 if//0 p//0 is//0 a//0 prime//0 number//0 .//0 
If//0 we//0 have//0 a//0 number//0 b//0 that//0 we//0 want//0 to//0 test//0 for//0 primality//0 ,//0 then//0 we//0 work//0 out//0 nb//0 (//0 mod//0 b//0 )//0 for//0 a//0 random//0 value//0 of//0 n//0 as//0 our//0 test//0 .//0 
A//0 flaw//0 with//0 this//0 test//0 is//0 that//0 there//0 are//0 some//0 composite//0 numbers//1 (//0 the//0 Carmichael//1 numbers//1 )//0 that//0 satisfy//0 the//0 Fermat//0 identity//0 even//0 though//0 they//0 are//0 not//0 prime//0 ,//0 so//0 the//0 test//0 has//0 no//0 way//0 of//0 distinguishing//0 between//0 prime//0 numbers//1 and//0 Carmichael//1 numbers//1 .//0

World//0 War//0 II//0 changed//0 the//0 demographics//0 of//0 the//0 city//1 ,//0 and//0 to//0 this//0 day//0 there//0 is//0 much//0 less//0 ethnic//0 diversity//0 than//0 in//0 the//0 previous//0 300//0 years//0 of//0 Warsaw//0 's//0 history//0 .//0 
Most//0 of//0 the//0 modern//0 day//0 population//0 growth//0 is//0 based//0 on//0 internal//0 migration//1 and//0 urbanisation//1 .//0 
In//0 1939//0 ,//0 c.//0 1,300,000//1 people//0 lived//0 in//0 Warsaw//0 ,//0 but//0 in//0 1945//0 –//0 only//0 420,000//1 .//0 
During//0 the//0 first//0 years//0 after//0 the//0 war//0 ,//0 the//0 population//0 growth//0 was//0 c.//0 6//0 %//0 ,//0 so//0 shortly//0 the//0 city//0 started//0 to//0 suffer//0 from//0 the//0 lack//0 of//0 flats//0 and//0 of//0 areas//0 for//0 new//0 houses//0 .//0 
The//0 first//0 remedial//0 measure//0 was//0 the//0 Warsaw//0 area//0 enlargement//0 (//0 1951//1 )//0 –//0 but//0 the//0 city//0 authorities//0 were//0 still//0 forced//0 to//0 introduce//0 residency//1 registration//1 limitations//0 ://0 only//0 the//0 spouses//0 and//0 children//0 of//0 the//0 permanent//0 residents//0 as//0 well//0 as//0 some//0 persons//0 of//0 public//0 importance//0 (//0 like//0 renowned//0 specialists//0 )//0 were//0 allowed//0 to//0 get//0 the//0 registration//1 ,//0 hence//0 halving//0 the//0 population//0 growth//0 in//0 the//0 following//0 years//0 .//0 
It//0 also//0 bolstered//0 some//0 kind//0 of//0 conviction//0 among//0 Poles//0 that//0 Varsovians//0 thought//1 of//0 themselves//0 as//0 better//1 only//0 because//0 they//0 lived//0 in//0 the//0 capital//0 .//0 
Unfortunately//0 this//0 belief//0 still//0 lives//0 on//0 in//0 Poland//0 (//0 although//0 not//0 as//0 much//0 as//0 it//0 used//0 to//0 be//0 )//0 –//0 even//0 though//0 since//0 1990//0 there//0 are//0 no//0 limitations//0 to//0 residency//1 registration//1 anymore//0 .//0 
Throughout//0 its//0 existence//0 ,//0 Warsaw//0 has//0 been//0 a//0 multi//0 -//0 cultural//0 city//1 .//0 
According//0 to//0 the//0 1901//0 census//0 ,//0 out//0 of//0 711,988//1 inhabitants//0 56.2//0 %//0 were//0 Catholics//0 ,//0 35.7//1 %//0 Jews//0 ,//0 5//0 %//0 Greek//0 orthodox//0 Christians//0 and//0 2.8//1 %//0 Protestants//0 .//0 
Eight//0 years//0 later//0 ,//0 in//0 1909//0 ,//0 there//0 were//0 281,754//0 Jews//0 (//0 36.9//0 %//0 )//0 ,//0 18,189//0 Protestants//0 (//0 2.4//0 %//0 )//0 and//0 2,818//0 Mariavites//0 (//0 0.4//0 %//0 )//0 .//0 
This//0 led//0 to//0 construction//0 of//0 hundreds//0 of//0 places//0 of//0 religious//0 worship//0 in//0 all//0 parts//0 of//0 the//0 town//0 .//0 
Most//0 of//0 them//0 were//0 destroyed//0 in//0 the//0 aftermath//0 of//0 the//0 Warsaw//0 Uprising//0 of//0 1944//1 .//0 
After//0 the//0 war//0 ,//0 the//0 new//0 communist//0 authorities//0 of//0 Poland//0 discouraged//0 church//0 construction//0 and//0 only//0 a//0 small//0 number//0 were//0 rebuilt//0 .//0 
The//0 basic//0 unit//0 of//0 territorial//0 division//0 in//0 Poland//0 is//0 a//0 commune//1 (//0 gmina//0 )//0 .//0 
A//0 city//0 is//0 also//0 a//0 commune//1 –//0 but//0 with//0 the//0 city//0 charter//0 .//0 
Both//0 cities//0 and//0 communes//0 are//0 governed//0 by//0 a//0 mayor//0 –//0 but//0 in//0 the//0 communes//0 the//0 mayor//0 is//0 vogt//0 (//0 wójt//0 in//0 Polish//0 )//0 ,//0 however//0 in//0 the//0 cities//0 –//0 burmistrz//0 .//0 
Some//0 bigger//0 cities//0 obtain//0 the//0 entitlements//0 ,//0 i.e.//0 tasks//0 and//0 privileges//0 ,//0 which//0 are//0 possessed//0 by//0 the//0 units//0 of//0 the//0 second//0 level//0 of//0 the//0 territorial//0 division//0 –//0 counties//1 or//0 powiats//1 .//0 
An//0 example//0 of//0 such//0 entitlement//0 is//0 a//0 car//0 registration//0 ://0 a//0 gmina//0 can//0 not//0 register//0 cars//0 ,//0 this//0 is//0 a//0 powiat//0 's//0 task//0 (//0 i.e.//0 a//0 registration//0 number//0 depends//0 on//0 what//0 powiat//0 a//0 car//0 had//0 been//0 registered//0 ,//0 not//0 gmina//0 )//0 .//0 
In//0 this//0 case//0 we//0 say//0 about//0 city//0 county//0 or//0 powiat//0 grodzki//0 .//0 
Such//0 cities//0 are//0 for//0 example//0 Lublin//0 ,//0 Kraków//1 ,//0 Gdańsk//0 ,//0 Poznań//0 .//0 
In//0 Warsaw//0 ,//0 its//0 districts//0 additionally//0 have//0 some//0 of//0 powiat//0 's//0 entitlements//0 –//0 like//0 already//0 mentioned//0 car//0 registration//0 .//0 
For//0 example//0 ,//0 the//0 district//0 Wola//0 has//0 its//0 own//0 evidence//0 and//0 the//0 district//0 Ursynów//0 –//0 its//0 own//0 (//0 and//0 the//0 cars//0 from//0 Wola//0 have//0 another//0 type//0 of//0 registration//0 number//0 than//0 these//0 from//0 Ursynów//0 )//0 .//0 
But//0 for//0 instance//0 the//0 districts//0 in//0 Kraków//1 do//0 not//0 have//0 entitlements//0 of//0 powiat//0 ,//0 so//0 the//0 registration//0 numbers//0 in//0 Kraków//1 are//0 of//0 the//0 same//0 type//0 for//0 all//0 districts//0 .//0 
Legislative//0 power//0 in//0 Warsaw//0 is//0 vested//0 in//0 a//0 unicameral//0 Warsaw//0 City//0 Council//0 (//0 Rada//0 Miasta//0 )//0 ,//0 which//0 comprises//0 60//1 members//0 .//0

Bills//0 passed//0 by//0 a//0 simple//0 majority//0 are//0 sent//0 to//0 the//0 mayor//0 (//0 the//0 President//0 of//0 Warsaw//0 )//0 ,//0 who//0 may//0 sign//0 them//0 into//0 law//0 .//0 
If//0 the//0 mayor//0 vetoes//0 a//0 bill//0 ,//0 the//0 Council//0 has//0 30//1 days//1 to//0 override//0 the//0 veto//0 by//0 a//0 two//0 -//0 thirds//0 majority//0 vote//0 .//0

Aristotle//1 provided//0 a//0 philosophical//0 discussion//0 of//0 the//0 concept//0 of//0 a//0 force//0 as//0 an//0 integral//0 part//0 of//0 Aristotelian//1 cosmology//1 .//0 
In//0 Aristotle//1 's//0 view//0 ,//0 the//0 terrestrial//0 sphere//0 contained//0 four//1 elements//0 that//0 come//0 to//0 rest//0 at//0 different//0 "//0 natural//1 places//0 "//0 therein//0 .//0 
Aristotle//1 believed//0 that//0 motionless//0 objects//0 on//0 Earth//0 ,//0 those//0 composed//0 mostly//0 of//0 the//0 elements//0 earth//0 and//0 water//0 ,//0 to//0 be//0 in//0 their//0 natural//1 place//0 on//0 the//0 ground//1 and//0 that//0 they//0 will//0 stay//0 that//0 way//0 if//0 left//0 alone//0 .//0

This//0 theory//0 ,//0 based//0 on//0 the//0 everyday//0 experience//0 of//0 how//0 objects//0 move//0 ,//0 such//0 as//0 the//0 constant//0 application//0 of//0 a//0 force//0 needed//0 to//0 keep//0 a//0 cart//0 moving//0 ,//0 had//0 conceptual//0 trouble//0 accounting//0 for//0 the//0 behavior//0 of//0 projectiles//0 ,//0 such//0 as//0 the//0 flight//0 of//0 arrows//0 .//0

Aristotle//1 was//0 aware//0 of//0 this//0 problem//0 and//0 proposed//0 that//0 the//0 air//0 displaced//0 through//0 the//0 projectile//0 's//0 path//0 carries//0 the//0 projectile//0 to//0 its//0 target//0 .//0

He//0 showed//0 that//0 the//0 bodies//0 were//0 accelerated//0 by//0 gravity//1 to//0 an//0 extent//0 that//0 was//0 independent//0 of//0 their//0 mass//0 and//0 argued//0 that//0 objects//0 retain//0 their//0 velocity//0 unless//0 acted//0 on//0 by//0 a//0 force//1 ,//0 for//0 example//0 friction//1 .//0 
Newton//1 's//0 First//1 Law//1 of//0 Motion//0 states//0 that//0 objects//0 continue//0 to//0 move//0 in//0 a//0 state//0 of//0 constant//0 velocity//0 unless//0 acted//0 upon//0 by//0 an//0 external//0 net//0 force//0 or//0 resultant//0 force//0 .//0 
This//0 law//1 is//0 an//0 extension//0 of//0 Galileo//0 's//0 insight//0 that//0 constant//0 velocity//0 was//0 associated//0 with//0 a//0 lack//0 of//0 net//0 force//0 (//0 see//0 a//0 more//0 detailed//0 description//0 of//0 this//0 below//0 )//0 .//0

That//0 is//0 ,//0 the//0 first//1 law//1 contradicts//0 the//0 intuitive//0 Aristotelian//0 belief//0 that//0 a//0 net//0 force//0 is//0 required//0 to//0 keep//0 an//0 object//0 moving//0 with//0 constant//0 velocity//0 .//0 
By//0 making//0 rest//0 physically//0 indistinguishable//0 from//0 non//0 -//0 zero//0 constant//0 velocity//0 ,//0 Newton//1 's//0 First//1 Law//1 directly//0 connects//0 inertia//0 with//0 the//0 concept//0 of//0 relative//0 velocities//0 .//0 
Specifically//0 ,//0 in//0 systems//0 where//0 objects//0 are//0 moving//0 with//0 different//0 velocities//0 ,//0 it//0 is//0 impossible//0 to//0 determine//0 which//0 object//0 is//0 "//0 in//0 motion//0 "//0 and//0 which//0 object//0 is//0 "//0 at//0 rest//0 "//0 .//0 
In//0 other//0 words//0 ,//0 to//0 phrase//0 matters//0 more//0 technically//0 ,//0 the//0 laws//0 of//0 physics//0 are//0 the//0 same//0 in//0 every//0 inertial//0 frame//0 of//0 reference//0 ,//0 that//0 is//0 ,//0 in//0 all//0 frames//0 related//0 by//0 a//0 Galilean//1 transformation//1 .//0 
For//0 instance//0 ,//0 while//0 traveling//0 in//0 a//0 moving//0 vehicle//0 at//0 a//0 constant//0 velocity//0 ,//0 the//0 laws//1 of//0 physics//1 do//0 not//0 change//0 from//0 being//0 at//0 rest//1 .//0 
A//0 person//0 can//0 throw//0 a//0 ball//0 straight//0 up//0 in//0 the//0 air//0 and//0 catch//0 it//0 as//0 it//0 falls//0 down//0 without//0 worrying//0 about//0 applying//0 a//0 force//0 in//0 the//0 direction//0 the//0 vehicle//0 is//0 moving//0 .//0

It//0 is//0 the//0 inertia//1 of//0 the//0 ball//0 associated//0 with//0 its//0 constant//0 velocity//0 in//0 the//0 direction//0 of//0 the//0 vehicle//0 's//0 motion//0 that//0 ensures//0 the//0 ball//0 continues//0 to//0 move//0 forward//0 even//0 as//0 it//0 is//0 thrown//0 up//0 and//0 falls//0 back//0 down//0 .//0 
From//0 the//0 perspective//0 of//0 the//0 person//0 in//0 the//0 car//0 ,//0 the//0 vehicle//0 and//0 everything//0 inside//0 of//0 it//0 is//0 at//0 rest//1 ://0 It//0 is//0 the//0 outside//0 world//0 that//0 is//0 moving//0 with//0 a//0 constant//0 speed//0 in//0 the//0 opposite//0 direction//0 .//0 
Since//0 there//0 is//0 no//0 experiment//0 that//0 can//0 distinguish//0 whether//0 it//0 is//0 the//0 vehicle//0 that//0 is//0 at//0 rest//1 or//0 the//0 outside//0 world//0 that//0 is//0 at//0 rest//1 ,//0 the//0 two//0 situations//0 are//0 considered//0 to//0 be//0 physically//0 indistinguishable//0 .//0

The//0 concept//0 of//0 inertia//1 can//0 be//0 further//0 generalized//0 to//0 explain//0 the//0 tendency//0 of//0 objects//0 to//0 continue//0 in//0 many//0 different//0 forms//0 of//0 constant//0 motion//0 ,//0 even//0 those//0 that//0 are//0 not//0 strictly//0 constant//0 velocity//0 .//0

Albert//1 Einstein//1 extended//0 the//0 principle//1 of//0 inertia//1 further//0 when//0 he//0 explained//0 that//0 reference//0 frames//0 subject//0 to//0 constant//0 acceleration//0 ,//0 such//0 as//0 those//0 free//0 -//0 falling//0 toward//0 a//0 gravitating//0 object//0 ,//0 were//0 physically//0 equivalent//0 to//0 inertial//0 reference//0 frames//0 .//0 
This//0 is//0 why//0 ,//0 for//0 example//0 ,//0 astronauts//0 experience//0 weightlessness//1 when//0 in//0 free//0 -//0 fall//0 orbit//0 around//0 the//0 Earth//0 ,//0 and//0 why//0 Newton//0 's//0 Laws//0 of//0 Motion//0 are//0 more//0 easily//0 discernible//0 in//0 such//0 environments//0 .//0 
If//0 an//0 astronaut//0 places//0 an//0 object//0 with//0 mass//0 in//0 mid//0 -//0 air//0 next//0 to//0 himself//0 ,//0 it//0 will//0 remain//0 stationary//0 with//0 respect//0 to//0 the//0 astronaut//0 due//0 to//0 its//0 inertia//1 .//0 
This//0 is//0 the//0 same//0 thing//0 that//0 would//0 occur//0 if//0 the//0 astronaut//0 and//0 the//0 object//0 were//0 in//0 intergalactic//0 space//0 with//0 no//0 net//0 force//0 of//0 gravity//0 acting//0 on//0 their//0 shared//0 reference//0 frame//0 .//0 
This//0 principle//1 of//0 equivalence//1 was//0 one//0 of//0 the//0 foundational//0 underpinnings//0 for//0 the//0 development//0 of//0 the//0 general//0 theory//0 of//0 relativity//0 .//0 
Newton//0 's//0 Second//0 Law//0 asserts//0 the//0 direct//0 proportionality//0 of//0 acceleration//0 to//0 force//0 and//0 the//0 inverse//0 proportionality//0 of//0 acceleration//0 to//0 mass//0 .//0

General//1 relativity//1 offers//0 an//0 equivalence//0 between//0 space//0 -//0 time//0 and//0 mass//0 ,//0 but//0 lacking//0 a//0 coherent//0 theory//0 of//0 quantum//0 gravity//0 ,//0 it//0 is//0 unclear//1 as//0 to//0 how//0 or//0 whether//0 this//0 connection//0 is//0 relevant//0 on//0 microscales//0 .//0 
With//0 some//0 justification//0 ,//0 Newton//0 's//0 second//0 law//0 can//0 be//0 taken//0 as//0 a//0 quantitative//0 definition//0 of//0 mass//0 by//0 writing//0 the//0 law//0 as//0 an//0 equality//1 ;//0 the//0 relative//0 units//0 of//0 force//0 and//0 mass//0 then//0 are//0 fixed//1 .//0

The//0 third//1 law//1 means//0 that//0 all//0 forces//0 are//0 interactions//0 between//0 different//0 bodies,[Note//0 3//0 ]//0 and//0 thus//0 that//0 there//0 is//0 no//0 such//0 thing//0 as//0 a//0 unidirectional//1 force//1 or//0 a//0 force//1 that//0 acts//0 on//0 only//0 one//0 body//0 .//0 
Whenever//0 a//0 first//0 body//0 exerts//0 a//0 force//1 F//0 on//0 a//0 second//0 body//0 ,//0 the//0 second//0 body//0 exerts//0 a//0 force//1 −F//0 on//0 the//0 first//0 body//0 .//0 
F//0 and//0 −F//0 are//0 equal//1 in//0 magnitude//1 and//0 opposite//0 in//0 direction//0 .//0 
This//0 law//1 is//0 sometimes//0 referred//0 to//0 as//0 the//0 action//0 -//0 reaction//0 law//1 ,//0 with//0 F//0 called//0 the//0 "//0 action//0 "//0 and//0 −F//0 the//0 "//0 reaction//0 "//0 .//0 
This//0 means//0 that//0 in//0 a//0 closed//1 system//1 of//0 particles//0 ,//0 there//0 are//0 no//0 internal//0 forces//0 that//0 are//0 unbalanced//0 .//0 
That//0 is//0 ,//0 the//0 action//0 -//0 reaction//0 force//0 shared//0 between//0 any//0 two//0 objects//0 in//0 a//0 closed//1 system//1 will//0 not//0 cause//0 the//0 center//1 of//0 mass//1 of//0 the//0 system//1 to//0 accelerate//0 .//0 
The//0 constituent//0 objects//0 only//0 accelerate//0 with//0 respect//0 to//0 each//0 other//0 ,//0 the//0 system//1 itself//0 remains//0 unaccelerated//0 .//0 
Since//0 forces//0 are//0 perceived//0 as//0 pushes//0 or//0 pulls//0 ,//0 this//0 can//0 provide//0 an//0 intuitive//1 understanding//1 for//0 describing//0 forces//0 .//0 
As//0 with//0 other//0 physical//0 concepts//0 (//0 e.g.//0 temperature//0 )//0 ,//0 the//0 intuitive//1 understanding//1 of//0 forces//0 is//0 quantified//0 using//0 precise//0 operational//0 definitions//0 that//0 are//0 consistent//0 with//0 direct//0 observations//0 and//0 compared//0 to//0 a//0 standard//0 measurement//0 scale//0 .//0

Forces//0 act//0 in//0 a//0 particular//0 direction//0 and//0 have//0 sizes//0 dependent//0 upon//0 how//0 strong//0 the//0 push//0 or//0 pull//0 is//0 .//0 
Because//0 of//0 these//0 characteristics//0 ,//0 forces//0 are//0 classified//0 as//0 "//0 vector//1 quantities//1 "//0 .//0 
This//0 means//0 that//0 forces//0 follow//0 a//0 different//0 set//0 of//0 mathematical//0 rules//0 than//0 physical//0 quantities//1 that//0 do//0 not//0 have//0 direction//0 (//0 denoted//0 scalar//1 quantities//1 )//0 .//0 
For//0 example//0 ,//0 when//0 determining//0 what//0 happens//0 when//0 two//0 forces//0 act//0 on//0 the//0 same//0 object//0 ,//0 it//0 is//0 necessary//0 to//0 know//0 both//0 the//0 magnitude//0 and//0 the//0 direction//0 of//0 both//0 forces//0 to//0 calculate//0 the//0 result//0 .//0 
If//0 both//0 of//0 these//0 pieces//0 of//0 information//0 are//0 not//0 known//0 for//0 each//0 force//0 ,//0 the//0 situation//0 is//0 ambiguous//1 .//0 
For//0 example//0 ,//0 if//0 you//0 know//0 that//0 two//0 people//0 are//0 pulling//0 on//0 the//0 same//0 rope//0 with//0 known//0 magnitudes//0 of//0 force//0 but//0 you//0 do//0 not//0 know//0 which//0 direction//0 either//0 person//0 is//0 pulling//0 ,//0 it//0 is//0 impossible//1 to//0 determine//0 what//0 the//0 acceleration//0 of//0 the//0 rope//0 will//0 be//0 .//0

In//0 this//0 simple//0 one//0 -//0 dimensional//0 example//0 ,//0 without//0 knowing//0 the//0 direction//0 of//0 the//0 forces//0 it//0 is//0 impossible//1 to//0 decide//0 whether//0 the//0 net//0 force//0 is//0 the//0 result//0 of//0 adding//0 the//0 two//0 force//0 magnitudes//0 or//0 subtracting//0 one//0 from//0 the//0 other//0 .//0

Galileo//1 realized//0 that//0 simple//0 velocity//0 addition//0 demands//0 that//0 the//0 concept//0 of//0 an//0 "//0 absolute//0 rest//1 frame//0 "//0 did//0 not//0 exist//0 .//0 
Galileo//1 concluded//0 that//0 motion//0 in//0 a//0 constant//0 velocity//0 was//0 completely//0 equivalent//0 to//0 rest//1 .//0
