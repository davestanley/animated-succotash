They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals.

Laird writes that Tibetans eagerly sought Ming court invitations since the gifts the Tibetans received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter . As for the Yongle Emperor 's gifts to his Tibetan and Nepalese vassals such as silver wares , Buddha relics , utensils for Buddhist temples and religious ceremonies , and gowns and robes for monks , Tsai writes \" in his effort to draw neighboring states to the Ming orbit so that he could bask in glory , the Yongle Emperor was quite willing to pay a small price \" . The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC lists the Tibetan tribute items as oxen , horses , camels , sheep , fur products , medical herbs , Tibetan incenses , thangkas ( painted scrolls ) , and handicrafts ; while the Ming awarded Tibetan tribute - bearers an equal value of gold , silver , satin and brocade , bolts of cloth , grains , and tea leaves . Silk workshops during the Ming also catered specifically to the Tibetan market with silk clothes and furnishings featuring Tibetan Buddhist iconography .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who did the Ming trade horses with?", "id": "56cd8d2962d2951400fa66e8", "answers": [{"text": "Tibet", "answer_start": 42}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was the leader of the T\u00fcmed Mongols?", "id": "56cd8d2962d2951400fa66e9", "answers": [{"text": "Altan Khan", "answer_start": 242}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Altan Khan overthrow?", "id": "56cd8d2962d2951400fa66ea", "answers": [{"text": "the Oirat Mongol confederation's hegemony", "answer_start": 307}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Altan Khan make peace with?", "id": "56cd8d2962d2951400fa66eb", "answers": [{"text": "the Ming dynasty", "answer_start": 6}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who convinced the Ming to reopen their border markets in 1573?", "id": "56cd8d2962d2951400fa66ec", "answers": [{"text": "Altan Khan", "answer_start": 242}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "While the Ming dynasty traded horses with Tibet, it upheld a policy of outlawing border markets in the north, which Laird sees as an effort to punish the Mongols for their raids and to \"drive them from the frontiers of China.\" However, after Altan Khan (1507\u20131582)\u2014leader of the T\u00fcmed Mongols who overthrew the Oirat Mongol confederation's hegemony over the steppes\u2014made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he persuaded the Ming to reopen their border markets in 1573.

Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the Yangtze , consuming 2,835 g ( 100 oz ) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in Chengdu of Sichuan . After procurring necessary gifts for the mission , he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000 troops . When the request was delivered , the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him . The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun 's camp , seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun 's entire escort . After this fiasco , Liu fled for his life , but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who said Tibet  wasn't an integral part of of China?", "id": "56ce1d0caab44d1400b8845e", "answers": [{"text": "Chinese writers of the early 20th century", "answer_start": 280}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does Sperling claim did not have any control over Tibet?", "id": "56ce1d0caab44d1400b8845f", "answers": [{"text": "China's intervening Ming dynasty", "answer_start": 707}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Since what century has Sperling described Ming and Tibet's relation being problematic for China?

Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as executive producers \u2014 and the non - Eon film Never Say Never Again , an updated remake of Thunderball , in 1983.[N 3 ] A second remake , entitled Warhead 2000 A.D. , was planned for production and release in the 1990s before being abandoned . Under the terms of the 1963 settlement , the literary rights stayed with Fleming , allowing the Spectre organisation and associated characters to continue appearing in print .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who ended up with ownership of Spectre?", "id": "56cdd83862d2951400fa68e0", "answers": [{"text": "MGM", "answer_start": 17}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was Spectre's original name?", "id": "56cdd83862d2951400fa68e1", "answers": [{"text": "SPECTRE", "answer_start": 354}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which company is Danjaq, LLC associated with?", "id": "56cdd83862d2951400fa68e2", "answers": [{"text": "Eon Productions", "answer_start": 106}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year were rights to Spectre worked out?", "id": "56cdd83862d2951400fa68e3", "answers": [{"text": "2013", "answer_start": 12}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which film studio won the full copyright film rights to Spectre?", "id": "56cf39c4aab44d1400b88eba", "answers": [{"text": "MGM", "answer_start": 17}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How was the Spectre acronym originally written?", "id": "56cf39c4aab44d1400b88ebb", "answers": [{"text": "Spectre", "answer_start": 190}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the LLC sister company of Eon Productions?", "id": "56cf39c4aab44d1400b88ebc", "answers": [{"text": "Danjaq", "answer_start": 76}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "MGM and the McClory estate", "answer_start": 17}], "question": "Which two parties settled the issue in November 2003?", "id": "5ad22870d7d075001a428558", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "MGM", "answer_start": 127}], "question": "Who got partial film rights to Spectre?", "id": "5ad22870d7d075001a428559", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Danjaq, LLC", "answer_start": 76}], "question": "The McClintock estate settled the issue with whom?", "id": "5ad22870d7d075001a42855a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Danjaq, LLC", "answer_start": 76}], "question": "Who is a brother company to Eon Productions?", "id": "5ad22870d7d075001a42855b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In November 2013 MGM and the McClory estate formally settled the issue with Danjaq, LLC\u2014sister company of Eon Productions\u2014with MGM acquiring the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with it.

The C - X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team Williams , who built the original C - X75 prototype for Jaguar .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where did Spectre filming take place after Rome?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c0", "answers": [{"text": "Mexico City", "answer_start": 52}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which celebration was featured in the Mexico City part of the production?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c1", "answers": [{"text": "Day of the Dead", "answer_start": 143}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which areas were shown in the Day of the Dead scene in Spectre?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c2", "answers": [{"text": "the Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district", "answer_start": 189}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many additional actors were needed for the shoot in Mexico City?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c3", "answers": [{"text": "1,500", "answer_start": 544}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where were the scenes featuring planes shot?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c4", "answers": [{"text": "Palenque", "answer_start": 681}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What festival was included in the scenes shot in Mexico?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f4c", "answers": [{"text": "the Day of the Dead festival", "answer_start": 139}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of helicopter was used for the flight scenes?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f4f", "answers": [{"text": "a Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter", "answer_start": 340}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where in Mexico were the Day of the Dead scenes shot?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f50", "answers": [{"text": "Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district", "answer_start": 193}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mexico", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "Filming moved to which city in late May?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286c8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mexico", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "In which city was the film's closing sequence filmed?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286c9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "city square", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "What was closed in order to film a fight sequence using a boat?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286ca", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "city", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "The scene in which square required about 2,500 extras?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286cb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "With filming completed in Rome, production moved to Mexico City in late March to shoot the film's opening sequence, with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed in and around the Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district.

He stated : \u201c For all its workmanlike devotion to out - of - control helicopters , \u201c Spectre \u201d works best when everyone \u2019s on the ground , doing his or her job , driving expensive fast cars heedlessly , detonating the occasional wisecrack , enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes . \u201d Guy Lodge from Variety , gave it a 70 score , stating : \u201c What \u2019s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of \u201c Skyfall , \u201d as the film sustains its predecessor \u2019s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent . \u201d", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which Atlantic writer gave a negative review of Spectre?", "id": "56cef65baab44d1400b88d35", "answers": [{"text": "Christopher Orr", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What adjective did Lawrence Toppman use to describe Craig's portrayal of James Bond?", "id": "56cef65baab44d1400b88d36", "answers": [{"text": "Bored", "answer_start": 201}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What publication does Alyssa Rosenberg write for?", "id": "56cef65baab44d1400b88d37", "answers": [{"text": "The Washington Post", "answer_start": 252}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the catch phrase Lawrence Toppman of the Charlotte Observer used for the film?", "id": "56cf6093aab44d1400b89180", "answers": [{"text": "Bored, James Bored", "answer_start": 201}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "backslides on virtually every [aspect]", "answer_start": 89}], "question": "Christopher Orr of the New Yorker said what about Spectre?", "id": "5ad24762d7d075001a428b32", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Bored, James Bored", "answer_start": 201}], "question": "Lawrence Toppman of The Boston Observer called Craig's performance what?", "id": "5ad24762d7d075001a428b33", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a disappointingly conventional Bond film", "answer_start": 307}], "question": "Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Observer said what about the film?", "id": "5ad24762d7d075001a428b34", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Observer", "answer_start": 164}], "question": "Lawrence Orr writes for The Charlotte what?", "id": "5ad24762d7d075001a428b35", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Christopher Orr, writing in The Atlantic, also criticised the film, saying that Spectre \"backslides on virtually every [aspect]\".

Inevitably , despite its mid-1930s setting , the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts , tensions , and fears induced by this transition . \"", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "The main jurors in Tom Robinson's trial were all which race?", "id": "56ce996caab44d1400b888c1", "answers": [{"text": "white", "answer_start": 371}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How did Tom Robinson die in the novel?", "id": "56ce996caab44d1400b888c2", "answers": [{"text": "shot seventeen times", "answer_start": 1237}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "At the time of the novel's setting, what punishment was often received by black males for percieved sexual contact with a white woman?", "id": "56d19bdee7d4791d00902073", "answers": [{"text": "death", "answer_start": 453}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who comprised Tom's jury?", "id": "56d19bdee7d4791d00902074", "answers": [{"text": "poor white farmers", "answer_start": 511}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many times was Tom shot?", "id": "56d19bdee7d4791d00902075", "answers": [{"text": "seventeen", "answer_start": 1242}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced.

By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie , one scholar writes , \" Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South , for with the use of first - person narration , she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child . \"", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In the book, which character was expected of molesting their child?", "id": "56cf4b72aab44d1400b88f75", "answers": [{"text": "Bob Ewell", "answer_start": 273}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was the only non-abusive father mentioned?", "id": "56d2581659d6e41400145edc", "answers": [{"text": "Atticus", "answer_start": 229}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel.

They can , however , be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "Horace de Saussure built the first box cooker in what year?", "id": "56ce61a4aab44d1400b88718", "answers": [{"text": "1767", "answer_start": 247}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Reflector cookers can reach temperatures in Celsius of up to what?", "id": "56ce61a4aab44d1400b88719", "answers": [{"text": "315", "answer_start": 749}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are solar cookers used for?", "id": "56cff5ff234ae51400d9c175", "answers": [{"text": "cooking, drying and pasteurization", "answer_start": 31}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the 3 main categories of solar cookers?", "id": "56cff5ff234ae51400d9c176", "answers": [{"text": "box cookers, panel cookers and reflector cookers", "answer_start": 116}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who created the box cooker?", "id": "56cff5ff234ae51400d9c177", "answers": [{"text": "Horace de Saussure", "answer_start": 225}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the typical temperature range for a box cooker?", "id": "56cff5ff234ae51400d9c178", "answers": [{"text": "90\u2013150 \u00b0C (194\u2013302 \u00b0F)", "answer_start": 429}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do reflector cookers require to function?", "id": "56cff5ff234ae51400d9c179", "answers": [{"text": "direct light", "answer_start": 787}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying and pasteurization.

The Carrefour boycott was met with anti - boycott demonstrators who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming , only to be blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles . The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing , Wuhan , Hefei , Kunming and Qingdao .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what publication were Chinese people asked to be orderly and legal because of the protests and demonstrations?", "id": "56d8da16dc89441400fdb344", "answers": [{"text": "People's Daily", "answer_start": 55}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the publication where Chinese people were advised to be calm and rational about patriotism?", "id": "56db0372e7c41114004b4c4b", "answers": [{"text": "People's Daily", "answer_start": 55}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Chinese people were told to show patriotism in an orderly and what manner?", "id": "56db0372e7c41114004b4c4c", "answers": [{"text": "legal", "answer_start": 206}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In response to the demonstrations, an editorial in the People's Daily urged Chinese people to \"express [their] patriotic enthusiasm calmly and rationally, and express patriotic aspiration in an orderly and legal manner\".", "allenNER": {"words": "In response to the demonstrations , an editorial in the People 's Daily urged Chinese people to \" express [ their ] patriotic enthusiasm calmly and rationally , and express patriotic aspiration in an orderly and legal manner \" .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What virgin site did the torch visit on April 2?", "id": "56d8dab9dc89441400fdb346", "answers": [{"text": "Almaty", "answer_start": 39}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was the first person to be handed the torch in Almaty?", "id": "56d8dab9dc89441400fdb347", "answers": [{"text": "Nursultan Nazarbaev.", "answer_start": 147}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who is Nursultan Nazarbaev?", "id": "56d8dab9dc89441400fdb348", "answers": [{"text": "the President of Kazakhstan", "answer_start": 119}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The route in Almaty went from Medeo Stadium to where?", "id": "56d8dab9dc89441400fdb349", "answers": [{"text": "Astana Square.", "answer_start": 210}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of activists were arrested in Almaty?", "id": "56d8dab9dc89441400fdb34a", "answers": [{"text": "Uighur activists", "answer_start": 249}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What country did the torch get to for the first time?", "id": "56db0495e7c41114004b4c4f", "answers": [{"text": "Kazakhstan", "answer_start": 2}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the president who was the first torchbearer in Almaty?", "id": "56db0495e7c41114004b4c50", "answers": [{"text": "Nursultan Nazarbaev.", "answer_start": 147}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the distance in kilometers for the route in Kazakhstan?", "id": "56db0495e7c41114004b4c52", "answers": [{"text": "20", "answer_start": 182}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What activists were reported to have been arrested?", "id": "56db0495e7c41114004b4c53", "answers": [{"text": "Uighur", "answer_start": 249}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "\n Kazakhstan: The first torchbearer in Almaty, where the Olympic torch arrived for the first time ever on April 2, was the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbaev.

The French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration was criticised by the Chinese State press agency Xinhua for its allegedly biased reporting ; Xinhua suggested that Lib\u00e9ration needed \" a stinging slap in the face \" for having \" insulted the Olympic flame \" and \" supported a handful of saboteurs \" .", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did the Chinese media focus on as far as human rights protesters?", "id": "56d97c68dc89441400fdb4dc", "answers": [{"text": "the more disruptive protesters", "answer_start": 85}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In response to pro-Tibet and pro-human rights protests, the Chinese media focused on the more disruptive protesters, referring for example to \"a very small number of 'Tibet independence' secessionists and a handful of so-called human rights-minded NGO activists\" intent on \"disrupting and sabotaging the Beijing Olympic Games\".

The aspects of this debate can follow the following lines : \u2022 To what degree is technology defined as a concept ? \u2022 What is the scope of technology discourse ? \u2022 What is the place and relation of science with technology ? \u2022 How useful is the Mitcham framework in thinking about technology in South Africa ? \u2022 Can a measure of cooperation as opposed to competition be achieved amongst higher education institutions ? \u2022 Who ultimately is responsible for vocational training and what is the role of technology in this ?", "tags": "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}}, {"qas": [{"question": "What name did some universities switch to in the 1990s for marketing purposes?", "id": "56ddb03066d3e219004dac9b", "answers": [{"text": "University of Technology", "answer_start": 354}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What system were institutes of technology a part of during the seventies, eighties, and early nineties?", "id": "56ddb03066d3e219004dac9c", "answers": [{"text": "College of Advanced Education system", "answer_start": 177}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "During the 1970s to early 1990s, the term was used to describe state owned and funded technical schools that offered both vocational and higher education.
