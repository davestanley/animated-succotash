Many//0 complexity//0 classes//0 are//0 defined//0 using//0 the//0 concept//0 of//0 a//0 reduction//1 .//0 
A//0 reduction//1 is//0 a//0 transformation//0 of//0 one//0 problem//1 into//0 another//1 problem//1 .//0 
It//0 captures//0 the//0 informal//0 notion//0 of//0 a//0 problem//1 being//0 at//0 least//0 as//0 difficult//0 as//0 another//1 problem//1 .//0 
For//0 instance//0 ,//0 if//0 a//0 problem//1 X//0 can//0 be//0 solved//0 using//0 an//0 algorithm//0 for//0 Y//0 ,//0 X//0 is//0 no//0 more//0 difficult//0 than//0 Y//0 ,//0 and//0 we//0 say//0 that//0 X//0 reduces//1 to//0 Y.//0 There//0 are//0 many//0 different//0 types//1 of//0 reductions//1 ,//0 based//0 on//0 the//0 method//0 of//0 reduction//1 ,//0 such//0 as//0 Cook//0 reductions//1 ,//0 Karp//0 reductions//1 and//0 Levin//0 reductions//1 ,//0 and//0 the//0 bound//0 on//0 the//0 complexity//0 of//0 reductions//1 ,//0 such//0 as//0 polynomial//0 -//0 time//0 reductions//1 or//0 log//0 -//0 space//0 reductions//1 .//0 
The//0 most//0 commonly//0 used//0 reduction//1 is//0 a//0 polynomial//1 -//0 time//1 reduction//1 .//0 
This//0 means//0 that//0 the//0 reduction//1 process//0 takes//0 polynomial//1 time//1 .//0 
For//0 example//0 ,//0 the//0 problem//0 of//0 squaring//0 an//0 integer//0 can//0 be//0 reduced//0 to//0 the//0 problem//0 of//0 multiplying//0 two//0 integers//0 .//0

Indeed//0 ,//0 this//0 can//0 be//0 done//0 by//0 giving//0 the//0 same//0 input//1 to//0 both//0 inputs//0 of//0 the//0 multiplication//1 algorithm//0 .//0 
Thus//0 we//0 see//0 that//0 squaring//0 is//0 not//0 more//0 difficult//0 than//0 multiplication//1 ,//0 since//0 squaring//0 can//0 be//0 reduced//0 to//0 multiplication//1 .//0 
This//0 motivates//0 the//0 concept//0 of//0 a//0 problem//0 being//0 hard//0 for//0 a//0 complexity//0 class//0 .//0 
A//0 problem//0 X//0 is//0 hard//0 for//0 a//0 class//0 of//0 problems//1 C//0 if//0 every//0 problem//0 in//0 C//0 can//0 be//0 reduced//0 to//0 X.//0 Thus//0 no//0 problem//0 in//0 C//0 is//0 harder//0 than//0 X//0 ,//0 since//0 an//0 algorithm//0 for//0 X//0 allows//0 us//0 to//0 solve//0 any//0 problem//0 in//0 C.//0 Of//0 course//0 ,//0 the//0 notion//0 of//0 hard//0 problems//1 depends//0 on//0 the//0 type//0 of//0 reduction//0 being//0 used//0 .//0 
For//0 complexity//0 classes//0 larger//0 than//0 P//0 ,//0 polynomial//0 -//0 time//0 reductions//0 are//0 commonly//0 used//0 .//0 
In//0 particular//0 ,//0 the//0 set//0 of//0 problems//1 that//0 are//0 hard//0 for//0 NP//0 is//0 the//0 set//0 of//0 NP//0 -//0 hard//0 problems//1 .//0 
If//0 a//0 problem//0 X//0 is//0 in//0 C//0 and//0 hard//0 for//0 C//0 ,//0 then//0 X//0 is//0 said//0 to//0 be//0 complete//0 for//0 C.//0 This//0 means//0 that//0 X//0 is//0 the//0 hardest//0 problem//0 in//0 C.//0 (//0 Since//0 many//0 problems//0 could//0 be//0 equally//0 hard//0 ,//0 one//0 might//0 say//0 that//0 X//0 is//0 one//0 of//0 the//0 hardest//0 problems//0 in//0 C.//0 )//0 Thus//0 the//0 class//0 of//0 NP//1 -//0 complete//0 problems//0 contains//0 the//0 most//0 difficult//0 problems//0 in//0 NP//1 ,//0 in//0 the//0 sense//0 that//0 they//0 are//0 the//0 ones//0 most//0 likely//0 not//0 to//0 be//0 in//0 P.//0 Because//0 the//0 problem//0 P//1 =//0 NP//1 is//0 not//0 solved//0 ,//0 being//0 able//0 to//0 reduce//0 a//0 known//0 NP//1 -//0 complete//0 problem//0 ,//0 Π2//0 ,//0 to//0 another//0 problem//0 ,//0 Π1//0 ,//0 would//0 indicate//0 that//0 there//0 is//0 no//0 known//0 polynomial//0 -//0 time//0 solution//0 for//0 Π1//0 .//0 
This//0 is//0 because//0 a//0 polynomial//0 -//0 time//0 solution//0 to//0 Π1//0 would//0 yield//0 a//0 polynomial//0 -//0 time//0 solution//0 to//0 Π2//0 .//0 
Similarly//0 ,//0 because//0 all//0 NP//1 problems//0 can//0 be//0 reduced//0 to//0 the//0 set//0 ,//0 finding//0 an//0 NP//1 -//0 complete//0 problem//0 that//0 can//0 be//0 solved//0 in//0 polynomial//0 time//0 would//0 mean//0 that//0 P//1 =//0 NP//1 .//0

Savery//0 's//0 steam//0 pump//0 used//0 condensing//0 steam//0 to//0 create//0 a//0 vacuum//0 and//0 draw//0 water//0 into//0 a//0 chamber//0 ,//0 and//0 then//0 applied//0 pressurized//0 steam//0 to//0 further//0 pump//0 the//0 water//0 .//0 
Thomas//0 Newcomen//0 's//0 atmospheric//0 engine//0 was//0 the//0 first//0 commercial//0 true//0 steam//0 engine//0 using//0 a//0 piston//0 ,//0 and//0 was//0 used//0 in//0 1712//1 for//0 pumping//0 in//0 a//0 mine//0 .//0 
A//0 steam//0 turbine//1 consists//0 of//0 one//0 or//0 more//0 rotors//0 (//0 rotating//1 discs//1 )//0 mounted//0 on//0 a//0 drive//1 shaft//1 ,//0 alternating//0 with//0 a//0 series//0 of//0 stators//0 (//0 static//1 discs//1 )//0 fixed//0 to//0 the//0 turbine//1 casing//1 .//0 
The//0 rotors//0 have//0 a//0 propeller//0 -//0 like//0 arrangement//0 of//0 blades//0 at//0 the//0 outer//0 edge//0 .//0 
Steam//0 acts//0 upon//0 these//0 blades//0 ,//0 producing//0 rotary//0 motion//0 .//0 
The//0 stator//0 consists//0 of//0 a//0 similar//0 ,//0 but//0 fixed//0 ,//0 series//0 of//0 blades//0 that//0 serve//0 to//0 redirect//0 the//0 steam//0 flow//0 onto//0 the//0 next//0 rotor//0 stage//0 .//0 
A//0 steam//0 turbine//1 often//0 exhausts//0 into//0 a//0 surface//0 condenser//0 that//0 provides//0 a//0 vacuum//0 .//0 
The//0 stages//0 of//0 a//0 steam//0 turbine//1 are//0 typically//0 arranged//0 to//0 extract//0 the//0 maximum//0 potential//0 work//0 from//0 a//0 specific//0 velocity//0 and//0 pressure//0 of//0 steam//0 ,//0 giving//0 rise//0 to//0 a//0 series//0 of//0 variably//0 sized//0 high-//0 and//0 low//0 -//0 pressure//0 stages//0 .//0 
Turbines//0 are//0 only//0 efficient//0 if//0 they//0 rotate//0 at//0 relatively//0 high//0 speed//0 ,//0 therefore//0 they//0 are//0 usually//0 connected//0 to//0 reduction//0 gearing//0 to//0 drive//1 lower//0 speed//0 applications//0 ,//0 such//0 as//0 a//0 ship//0 's//0 propeller//0 .//0 
In//0 the//0 vast//0 majority//0 of//0 large//0 electric//0 generating//0 stations//0 ,//0 turbines//0 are//0 directly//0 connected//0 to//0 generators//0 with//0 no//0 reduction//0 gearing//0 .//0 
Typical//0 speeds//0 are//0 3600//0 revolutions//0 per//0 minute//0 (//0 RPM//0 )//0 in//0 the//0 USA//0 with//0 60//0 Hertz//0 power//0 ,//0 3000//0 RPM//0 in//0 Europe//0 and//0 other//0 countries//0 with//0 50//0 Hertz//0 electric//0 power//0 systems//0 .//0 
In//0 nuclear//0 power//0 applications//0 the//0 turbines//0 typically//0 run//0 at//0 half//0 these//0 speeds//0 ,//0 1800//0 RPM//0 and//0 1500//0 RPM//0 .//0 
A//0 turbine//1 rotor//0 is//0 also//0 only//0 capable//0 of//0 providing//0 power//0 when//0 rotating//1 in//0 one//0 direction//0 .//0 
The//0 weight//0 of//0 boilers//0 and//0 condensers//0 generally//0 makes//0 the//0 power//0 -//0 to//0 -//0 weight//0 ratio//0 of//0 a//0 steam//1 plant//0 lower//1 than//0 for//0 internal//0 combustion//0 engines//0 .//0 
For//0 mobile//0 applications//0 steam//1 has//0 been//0 largely//0 superseded//0 by//0 internal//0 combustion//0 engines//0 or//0 electric//1 motors//1 .//0 
However//0 ,//0 most//0 electric//1 power//0 is//0 generated//0 using//0 steam//1 turbine//1 plant//0 ,//0 so//0 that//0 indirectly//0 the//0 world//0 's//0 industry//0 is//0 still//0 dependent//0 on//0 steam//1 power//0 .//0 
Recent//0 concerns//0 about//0 fuel//0 sources//0 and//0 pollution//1 have//0 incited//0 a//0 renewed//0 interest//0 in//0 steam//1 both//0 as//0 a//0 component//0 of//0 cogeneration//1 processes//1 and//0 as//0 a//0 prime//0 mover//0 .//0 
It//0 is//0 possible//0 to//0 use//0 a//0 mechanism//0 based//0 on//0 a//0 pistonless//0 rotary//0 engine//1 such//0 as//0 the//0 Wankel//1 engine//1 in//0 place//0 of//0 the//0 cylinders//0 and//0 valve//0 gear//0 of//0 a//0 conventional//0 reciprocating//0 steam//0 engine//1 .//0 
Many//0 such//0 engines//0 have//0 been//0 designed//0 ,//0 from//0 the//0 time//0 of//0 James//0 Watt//0 to//0 the//0 present//0 day//0 ,//0 but//0 relatively//0 few//0 were//0 actually//0 built//0 and//0 even//0 fewer//0 went//0 into//0 quantity//0 production//0 ;//0 see//0 link//0 at//0 bottom//0 of//0 article//0 for//0 more//0 details//0 .//0 
The//0 major//0 problem//0 is//0 the//0 difficulty//0 of//0 sealing//0 the//0 rotors//0 to//0 make//0 them//0 steam//0 -//0 tight//0 in//0 the//0 face//0 of//0 wear//0 and//0 thermal//1 expansion//1 ;//0 the//0 resulting//0 leakage//0 made//0 them//0 very//0 inefficient//0 .//0 
The//0 next//0 major//0 step//0 occurred//0 when//0 James//0 Watt//0 developed//0 (//0 1763–1775//1 )//0 an//0 improved//0 version//0 of//0 Newcomen//1 's//0 engine//0 ,//0 with//0 a//0 separate//1 condenser//1 .//0 
Boulton//0 and//0 Watt//0 's//0 early//0 engines//0 used//0 half//1 as//0 much//1 coal//0 as//0 John//0 Smeaton//0 's//0 improved//0 version//0 of//0 Newcomen//1 's//0 .//0 
Newcomen//1 's//0 and//0 Watt//0 's//0 early//0 engines//0 were//0 "//0 atmospheric//0 "//0 .//0 
They//0 were//0 powered//0 by//0 air//0 pressure//0 pushing//0 a//0 piston//1 into//0 the//0 partial//0 vacuum//0 generated//0 by//0 condensing//0 steam//0 ,//0 instead//0 of//0 the//0 pressure//0 of//0 expanding//0 steam//0 .//0 
The//0 engine//0 cylinders//0 had//0 to//0 be//0 large//0 because//0 the//0 only//0 usable//0 force//0 acting//0 on//0 them//0 was//0 due//0 to//0 atmospheric//0 pressure//0 .//0 
Steam//0 engines//0 frequently//0 possess//0 two//1 independent//0 mechanisms//0 for//0 ensuring//0 that//0 the//0 pressure//0 in//0 the//0 boiler//0 does//0 not//0 go//0 too//0 high//0 ;//0 one//0 may//0 be//0 adjusted//0 by//0 the//0 user//0 ,//0 the//0 second//0 is//0 typically//0 designed//0 as//0 an//0 ultimate//0 fail//0 -//0 safe//0 .//0 
Such//0 safety//0 valves//0 traditionally//0 used//0 a//0 simple//0 lever//0 to//0 restrain//0 a//0 plug//1 valve//1 in//0 the//0 top//0 of//0 a//0 boiler//0 .//0 
One//0 end//0 of//0 the//0 lever//0 carried//0 a//0 weight//0 or//0 spring//0 that//0 restrained//0 the//0 valve//1 against//0 steam//0 pressure//0 .//0 
Early//0 valves//0 could//0 be//0 adjusted//0 by//0 engine//0 drivers//0 ,//0 leading//0 to//0 many//0 accidents//0 when//0 a//0 driver//0 fastened//0 the//0 valve//1 down//0 to//0 allow//0 greater//0 steam//0 pressure//0 and//0 more//0 power//1 from//0 the//0 engine//0 .//0 
The//0 more//0 recent//0 type//0 of//0 safety//0 valve//1 uses//0 an//0 adjustable//1 spring//0 -//0 loaded//0 valve//1 ,//0 which//0 is//0 locked//0 such//0 that//0 operators//0 may//0 not//0 tamper//0 with//0 its//0 adjustment//0 unless//0 a//0 seal//1 illegally//0 is//0 broken//0 .//0 
The//0 acme//0 of//0 the//0 horizontal//0 engine//0 was//0 the//0 Corliss//1 steam//0 engine//0 ,//0 patented//0 in//0 1849//1 ,//0 which//0 was//0 a//0 four//1 -//0 valve//0 counter//0 flow//0 engine//0 with//0 separate//0 steam//0 admission//0 and//0 exhaust//0 valves//0 and//0 automatic//0 variable//0 steam//0 cutoff//0 .//0 
When//0 Corliss//1 was//0 given//0 the//0 Rumford//1 medal//1 the//0 committee//0 said//0 that//0 "//0 no//0 one//0 invention//0 since//0 Watt//0 's//0 time//0 has//0 so//0 enhanced//0 the//0 efficiency//0 of//0 the//0 steam//0 engine//0 "//0 .//0 
In//0 addition//0 to//0 using//0 30//0 %//0 less//0 steam//0 ,//0 it//0 provided//0 more//0 uniform//0 speed//0 due//0 to//0 variable//0 steam//0 cut//0 off//0 ,//0 making//0 it//0 well//0 suited//0 to//0 manufacturing//0 ,//0 especially//0 cotton//0 spinning//0 .//0 
The//0 steam//0 engine//0 contributed//0 much//0 to//0 the//0 development//0 of//0 thermodynamic//1 theory//1 ;//0 however//0 ,//0 the//0 only//0 applications//0 of//0 scientific//0 theory//1 that//0 influenced//0 the//0 steam//0 engine//0 were//0 the//0 original//0 concepts//0 of//0 harnessing//0 the//0 power//0 of//0 steam//0 and//0 atmospheric//0 pressure//0 and//0 knowledge//0 of//0 properties//0 of//0 heat//1 and//0 steam//0 .//0 
The//0 experimental//0 measurements//0 made//0 by//0 Watt//1 on//0 a//0 model//0 steam//0 engine//0 led//0 to//0 the//0 development//0 of//0 the//0 separate//1 condenser//1 .//0 
Watt//1 independently//0 discovered//0 latent//1 heat//1 ,//0 which//0 was//0 confirmed//0 by//0 the//0 original//0 discoverer//0 Joseph//1 Black//1 ,//0 who//0 also//0 advised//0 Watt//1 on//0 experimental//0 procedures//0 .//0 
Watt//1 was//0 also//0 aware//0 of//0 the//0 change//0 in//0 the//0 boiling//0 point//0 of//0 water//0 with//0 pressure//0 .//0 
Otherwise//0 ,//0 the//0 improvements//0 to//0 the//0 engine//0 itself//0 were//0 more//0 mechanical//0 in//0 nature//0 .//0 
The//0 thermodynamic//1 concepts//0 of//0 the//0 Rankine//0 cycle//0 did//0 give//0 engineers//0 the//0 understanding//0 needed//0 to//0 calculate//0 efficiency//0 which//0 aided//0 the//0 development//0 of//0 modern//0 high//0 -//0 pressure//0 and//0 -temperature//0 boilers//0 and//0 the//0 steam//0 turbine//0 .//0 
One//0 of//0 the//0 principal//0 advantages//0 the//0 Rankine//0 cycle//0 holds//0 over//0 others//0 is//0 that//0 during//0 the//0 compression//0 stage//0 relatively//0 little//0 work//0 is//0 required//0 to//0 drive//0 the//0 pump//0 ,//0 the//0 working//0 fluid//0 being//0 in//0 its//0 liquid//1 phase//1 at//0 this//0 point//0 .//0 
By//0 condensing//0 the//0 fluid//0 ,//0 the//0 work//0 required//0 by//0 the//0 pump//0 consumes//0 only//0 1//0 %//0 to//0 3//0 %//0 of//0 the//0 turbine//0 power//0 and//0 contributes//0 to//0 a//0 much//0 higher//0 efficiency//0 for//0 a//0 real//0 cycle//0 .//0 
The//0 benefit//0 of//0 this//0 is//0 lost//0 somewhat//0 due//0 to//0 the//0 lower//0 heat//0 addition//0 temperature//0 .//0 
Gas//0 turbines//0 ,//0 for//0 instance//0 ,//0 have//0 turbine//0 entry//0 temperatures//0 approaching//0 1500//1 °//0 C//0 .//0

Land//0 -//0 based//0 steam//0 engines//0 could//0 exhaust//0 much//0 of//0 their//0 steam//0 ,//0 as//0 feed//1 water//1 was//0 usually//0 readily//0 available//0 .//0

The//0 Rankine//0 cycle//0 is//0 sometimes//0 referred//0 to//0 as//0 a//0 practical//0 Carnot//0 cycle//0 because//0 ,//0 when//0 an//0 efficient//0 turbine//0 is//0 used//0 ,//0 the//0 TS//0 diagram//0 begins//0 to//0 resemble//0 the//0 Carnot//0 cycle//0 .//0 
The//0 main//0 difference//0 is//0 that//0 heat//0 addition//0 (//0 in//0 the//0 boiler//0 )//0 and//0 rejection//0 (//0 in//0 the//0 condenser//1 )//0 are//0 isobaric//0 (//0 constant//1 pressure//1 )//0 processes//0 in//0 the//0 Rankine//0 cycle//0 and//0 isothermal//1 (//0 constant//1 temperature//0 )//0 processes//0 in//0 the//0 theoretical//0 Carnot//0 cycle//0 .//0

Richard//1 Harbison//1 's//0 purely//0 morphological//0 analysis//0 in//0 1985//0 concluded//0 that//0 the//0 cydippids//0 are//0 not//0 monophyletic//1 ,//0 in//0 other//0 words//0 do//0 not//0 contain//0 all//0 and//0 only//0 the//0 descendants//0 of//0 a//0 single//0 common//0 ancestor//0 that//0 was//0 itself//0 a//0 cydippid//0 .//0

When//0 a//0 rock//1 crystallizes//0 from//0 melt//1 (//0 magma//1 and/or//0 lava//0 )//0 ,//0 it//0 is//0 an//0 igneous//1 rock//1 .//0

In//0 the//0 1960s//1 ,//0 a//0 series//0 of//0 discoveries//0 ,//0 the//0 most//0 important//0 of//0 which//0 was//0 seafloor//1 spreading//1 ,//0 showed//0 that//0 the//0 Earth//0 's//0 lithosphere//0 ,//0 which//0 includes//0 the//0 crust//0 and//0 rigid//0 uppermost//0 portion//0 of//0 the//0 upper//0 mantle//1 ,//0 is//0 separated//0 into//0 a//0 number//0 of//0 tectonic//0 plates//0 that//0 move//0 across//0 the//0 plastically//0 deforming//0 ,//0 solid//0 ,//0 upper//0 mantle//1 ,//0 which//0 is//0 called//0 the//0 asthenosphere//1 .//0 
There//0 is//0 an//0 intimate//0 coupling//0 between//0 the//0 movement//0 of//0 the//0 plates//0 on//0 the//0 surface//0 and//0 the//0 convection//1 of//0 the//0 mantle//1 ://0 oceanic//0 plate//0 motions//0 and//0 mantle//1 convection//1 currents//0 always//0 move//0 in//0 the//0 same//0 direction//0 ,//0 because//0 the//0 oceanic//0 lithosphere//0 is//0 the//0 rigid//0 upper//0 thermal//0 boundary//0 layer//0 of//0 the//0 convecting//1 mantle//1 .//0 
This//0 coupling//0 between//0 rigid//0 plates//0 moving//0 on//0 the//0 surface//0 of//0 the//0 Earth//0 and//0 the//0 convecting//1 mantle//1 is//0 called//0 plate//0 tectonics//0 .//0

The//0 power//0 of//0 the//0 theory//0 of//0 plate//0 tectonics//0 lies//0 in//0 its//0 ability//0 to//0 combine//0 all//0 of//0 these//0 observations//0 into//0 a//0 single//0 theory//0 of//0 how//0 the//0 lithosphere//0 moves//0 over//0 the//0 convecting//1 mantle//1 .//0

The//1 second//0 scale//0 compresses//0 the//1 most//0 recent//0 era//0 ,//0 so//0 the//1 most//0 recent//0 era//0 is//0 expanded//0 in//0 the//1 third//0 scale//0 .//0 
Since//0 the//1 Quaternary//1 is//0 a//0 very//0 short//0 period//1 with//0 short//0 epochs//0 ,//0 it//0 is//0 further//0 expanded//0 in//0 the//1 fourth//0 scale//0 .//0

The//0 principle//0 of//0 cross//0 -//0 cutting//0 relationships//1 pertains//0 to//0 the//0 formation//0 of//0 faults//0 and//0 the//0 age//0 of//0 the//0 sequences//0 through//0 which//0 they//0 cut//0 .//0 
Faults//0 are//0 younger//1 than//0 the//0 rocks//0 they//0 cut//0 ;//0 accordingly//0 ,//0 if//0 a//0 fault//1 is//0 found//0 that//0 penetrates//0 some//0 formations//0 but//0 not//0 those//0 on//0 top//0 of//0 it//0 ,//0 then//0 the//0 formations//0 that//0 were//0 cut//0 are//0 older//1 than//0 the//0 fault//1 ,//0 and//0 the//0 ones//0 that//0 are//0 not//0 cut//0 must//0 be//0 younger//1 than//0 the//0 fault//1 .//0 
Finding//0 the//0 key//1 bed//1 in//0 these//0 situations//0 may//0 help//0 determine//0 whether//0 the//0 fault//1 is//0 a//0 normal//0 fault//1 or//0 a//0 thrust//0 fault//1 .//0 
The//0 principle//0 of//0 inclusions//1 and//0 components//1 states//0 that//0 ,//0 with//0 sedimentary//0 rocks//0 ,//0 if//0 inclusions//1 (//0 or//0 clasts//1 )//0 are//0 found//0 in//0 a//0 formation//0 ,//0 then//0 the//0 inclusions//1 must//0 be//0 older//0 than//0 the//0 formation//0 that//0 contains//0 them//0 .//0

When//0 rock//0 units//0 are//0 placed//0 under//0 horizontal//1 compression//1 ,//0 they//0 shorten//0 and//0 become//0 thicker//0 .//0
